* boat
* captain
* head
* sea

Solution
========

We extract the information using

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
MobyDick_raw <- filter( Books, title == "Moby Dick" )

MobyDick_raw %>% 
  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%
  mutate( word = gsub( "_", "", word ) ) %>%
  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>%
  anti_join( stop_words, by="word" ) %>%
  slice_head( n=5 )
```

We find that whale, ahab, sea, ship and ye are the five most common words (excluding stop words).
