> [!TIP]
> **Quick Guide: The YAML Header**
>
> The lines between the `---` at the top of this file are called the **YAML header**. This is where you set the document's metadata: title, author, date, and output format. Think of it like the "settings panel" for your report. For more details, see the [Computing Setup Guide](https://kanayai.github.io/ma22019_website/computing_setup/setup.html).

> [!NOTE]
> **Tips for Working in Quarto**
>
> - **Use Source Mode**: Click the "Source" button (top-left of this pane) to see the raw code. This helps you understand what's happening behind the scenes.
> - **Render Often**: Hit the **Render** button every few minutes to catch errors early. Don't wait until you've written 100 lines!
> - **File Naming**: Always use `snake_case` for file names (e.g., `my_analysis.qmd`, not `My Analysis.qmd`). See the [Golden Rules](#bonus-the-golden-rules-of-file-naming) at the end of this document.



# 👋 Welcome to the Git Workflow!

If you are reading this in RStudio, **CONGRATULATIONS!** 
You have successfully cloned your first repository. 
That is 50% of the battle won.

Today, we will finish the setup by learning how to **save** your work back to the cloud.

---

## Step 0: Verify Location (New!)
 
Before we start, let's make sure you are in the right place.
 
1.  Look at the **Console** pane (bottom left).
2.  Type `source("check_location.R")` and press Enter.
3.  If it says **SUCCESS**, you are good to go!
4.  If it says **WARNING**, ask a TA for help immediately.

## Step 1: Tell Us Who You Are

We need to make sure your name appears correctly on your work.

1.  Look at the top of this file (lines 1-5).
2.  Find the line that says: `author: "Your Name Here"`.
3.  Change `"Your Name Here"` to **your actual name** (e.g., `"Jane Doe"`).
4.  Save this file (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S).

### (Optional) Update your GitHub Profile

Since we are setting things up, take a moment to look professional.

1.  Click on your profile icon in the upper right corner of the [GitHub page](https://github.bath.ac.uk) and select **Settings**.
2.  On the left side, click **Public profile**.
3.  Fill out your information and **Add a profile picture** (it helps TAs learn your name!).
4.  Click **Update profile**.

---

## Step 2: Render to Markdown

In this course, we produce professional reports. Let's make one now.

1.  Look for the **Render** button at the top of this pane (it has a blue right pointed arrow icon  icon here ).
2.  Click **Render**.
    *   *Note: If a popup asks you to install packages, say Yes.*
3.  A beautiful Markdown file should appear (previewed in RStudio).

> **Checkpoint**: Do you see your name in the title of the Markdown report?

---

## Step 3: The "Save" vs "Commit" Reality Check (CRITICAL)

You have just saved the file (Cmd+S) and Rendered it. 

**STOP AND THINK**: Where are these changes?

*   ✅ They are on your **laptop's hard drive**.
*   ❌ They are **NOT on GitHub** yet.

### Prove it to yourself:

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Go to your repository page on **github.bath.ac.uk** (refresh the page).
3.  Look at `lab_00.qmd`.
4.  Does it show your actual name? 
    *   **NO**, it still says `"Your Name Here"`.
    *   This is because "Saving" only happens on your computer.

To get it to GitHub, we need the **Git Cycle**: **Stage -> Commit -> Push**.

---

## Step 4: The Build-up (Stage & Commit)

Think of this like online shopping.

1.  **Stage (The Shopping Basket)**

    *   Go to the **Git Pane** (top right in RStudio).
    *   Tick the **Staged** box next to `lab_00.qmd`.
    *   *Meaning: "I want to include this file in my next package."*

2.  **Commit (The Order Confirmation)**
    *   Click the **Commit** button.
    *   Type a message: `"Fixed author name"`.
    *   Click **Commit**.
    *   *Meaning: "I have sealed the package."*

**PAUSE**: Even now, check GitHub again. **It is still not there!** 
A "Commit" is still only on your laptop (it's a saved version in your local Git history).

---

## Step 5: The Release (Push)

This is the only step that moves data to the cloud.

1.  **Push (The Delivery)**
    *   Click the **Green Up Arrow** ⬆️ (Push) in the Git pane.
    *   Wait for the message `HEAD -> main`.

---

## Step 6: Final Verification

1.  Go back to your web browser.
2.  **Refresh** the GitHub page.
3.  Look at `lab_00.qmd`.
4.  **NOW** it should show your actual name.
5.  Look for `lab_00.md`. It should be there too! (And if you click it, it looks great!)

✅ **Mission Accomplished**: You now understand the difference between *Saving* (Local) and *Pushing* (Cloud).

## One Last Thing: Prove R Works

Run this code chunk just to see a cool plot.

```{r}
#| label: test-plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
    geom_point(size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(
        title = "My First R Plot",
        subtitle = "If you can see this, R is working perfectly.",
        x = "Engine Size",
        y = "Highway MPG"
    )
```

## Bonus: The Golden Rules of File Naming

As a Data Scientist, you will generate hundreds of files. If you name them poorly, you will lose them.

> [!TIP]
> **The 3 Principles**
>
> 1.  **Machine Readable:** No spaces, punctuation, or accents. Use `_` or `-`.
> 2.  **Human Readable:** Meaningful names. `analysis.R` is bad; `01_data_cleaning.R` is good.
> 3.  **Sortable:** Use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and numbered prefixes (`01_`, `02_`).

### Examples

| Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|--------|---------|
| `my abstract.docx` | `2025-02-15_abstract.docx` |
| `Joe's File.xlsx` | `joes_file.csv` |
| `figure 1.png` | `fig01_scatterplot.png` |
| `final_final_v2.R` | `04_model_evaluation.R` |

**Apply these rules to every file you create from now on!**
