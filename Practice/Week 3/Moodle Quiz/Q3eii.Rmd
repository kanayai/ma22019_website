Question
========
We learned that box plots should usually be ordered based on a criteria, such as the median. Should this approach also be taken for the box plot you created in part d)?

Answerlist
----------
* Yes
* No


Solution
========
No, it's better to keep the plot as it is presented in part d). In general, we should not reorder the categorical variables when they are ordinal, i.e., when there is a logical ordering to them. Another example would be star ratings - in this case we also should not change the order of the variables. For the example above, not changing the order of the months makes it, for instance, easier to visualize seasonal effects.
