Question
========

What was the monthly average temperature for Rio de Janeiro when Sao Paulo recorded its highest monthly average temperature?

Solution
========

We first load and combine the data sets

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Rio <- read.csv( "Rio Temperature.csv" )
SaoPaulo <- read.csv( "Sao Paulo Temperature.csv" )

Temperature <- full_join( SaoPaulo, Rio, by=c("YEAR"="YEAR", "MONTH"="MONTH") )
Temperature <- Temperature %>%
  rename( "SaoPaulo" = TEMPERATURE.x, "Rio" = TEMPERATURE.y )
```

One way is to then sort the data based on the temperature for Sao Paulo and to extract the first entry:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Temperature %>%
  arrange( desc(SaoPaulo) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=1 )
```
