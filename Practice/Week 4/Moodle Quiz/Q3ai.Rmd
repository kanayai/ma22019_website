Solution
========

We can for instance produce a plot which plots day of the year against temperature:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
BrisbaneGoldCoast <- read.csv("BrisbaneGoldCoast.csv")

BrisbaneGoldCoast <- BrisbaneGoldCoast %>% 
  mutate( Date = as_date( Date, format="%d/%m/%Y" ) )

GoldCoast <- filter( BrisbaneGoldCoast, Location=="GoldCoast" )

ggplot( GoldCoast, aes( x=Date, y=MaxTemp ) ) + 
  geom_line( ) + labs( x="Date", y="Maximum Temperature" )
```
