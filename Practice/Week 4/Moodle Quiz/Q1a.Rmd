Question
========
Which two countries recorded the highest total CO$_2$ emissions across all sectors for the considered time window? 

Answerlist
----------
* Brazil
* China
* France
* Germany
* India
* Italy
* Japan
* Russia
* Spain
* UK
* United States


Solution
========

We extract the information using

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
CO2 <- read.csv( "data/CO2 Emissions.csv", header=TRUE )

CO2 %>%
  group_by( country ) %>%
  summarize( Total=sum( emissions) ) %>%
  arrange( desc(Total) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=5 )
```

The US and China are the two top countries according to this list.
