Solution
========
The most earthquakes were recorded in 2011. We extract this information using

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Earthquakes$Date <- as_date( Earthquakes$Date, format='%m/%d/%Y' )

Earthquakes %>% 
  group_by( year(Date) ) %>%
  summarize( "Number_Earthquakes" = n() ) %>%
  arrange( desc(Number_Earthquakes) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=2 )
```
