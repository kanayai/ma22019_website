Question
========
Which issue with the raw data may be addressed by using the rename() function? 


Answerlist
----------
* Variable names are uninformative;
* Data types are incompatible with available R functions;
* We are only interested in a subset of the data.

Solution
========
When we want to change variable names, the function rename() is the easiest option. So this function is useful to deal with uninformative variable names, i.e., the first issue.
