Question
========
Which issue with the raw data may be addressed by using the slice_head() function? 


Answerlist
----------
* Variable names are uninformative;
* Data types are incompatible with available R functions;
* We are only interested in a subset of the data.

Solution
========
The function slice_head() returns the first few elements of the data frame. We have to specify how many elements we want to print using the option n=... For instance, n=5 prints the first five lines. As such, this function is useful if we are just interested in exploring the first few lines of a data frame, i.e. it may address the first issue.
