Question
========
Which issue with the raw data may be addressed by using the as_numeric() function? 


Answerlist
----------
* Variable names are uninformative;
* Data types are incompatible with available R functions;
* We are only interested in a subset of the data.

Solution
========
 The function as_numeric() converts a variable of type character into a variable of type numeric. This function is useful when we read data as character but actually need to use it for calculations, i.e., it again addresses the second issue.
