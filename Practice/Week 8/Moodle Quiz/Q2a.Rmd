Question
========
Does the semi-variogram suggest that dependence decreases with an increasing distance between spatial sites?

Answerlist
----------
* Yes
* No

Solution
========

We can create the semi-variogram using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Meuse <- read.csv("data/Meuse.csv")

coordinates( Meuse ) <- ~Lon+Lat
gamma_hat <- variogram( zinc~1, Meuse )

ggplot( gamma_hat, aes( x=dist, y=gamma/2 ) ) + geom_point( size=2 ) + 
  theme_bw() + labs( x="Distance", y="Semi-variogram" )
```

We find that the value in the semi-variogram increases with increasing spatial distance. We thus conclude that the dependence decreases with an increasing distance between sites.
