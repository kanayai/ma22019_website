Question
========
When considering strength of mobile phone signal, which type of spatial data (point-referenced, point pattern or lattice/areal data) are mostly likely working with?

Answerlist
----------
		
* Point-referenced
* Point pattern
* Lattice/areal

Solution
========

Such data could be collected by measuring signal strength at a number of fixed locations. This would then give point-referenced data.
