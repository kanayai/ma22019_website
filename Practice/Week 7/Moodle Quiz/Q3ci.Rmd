Question
========
What is the type of data we are working with when considering earthquakes and their magnitudes? 

Answerlist
----------
		
* Point-referenced
* Point pattern
* Lattice/areal

Solution
========
The locations at which eartquakes occur are random and thus we are working with point pattern data. The difference to the other examples we considered is that the points also have a value (the magnitude) attached to them. This is also referred to as a marked point process.
