Question
========
Which was the most coming baby name over the period 1880-2017?

Answerlist
----------
* James
* John
* Michael
* Robert	


Solution
========

We start by loading the data set:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Babies <- read.csv("data/Babynames.csv")
```

To find the most common name, we have to sum up the counts across the different years:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Babies %>%
  group_by( Name=name ) %>%
  summarise( Count = sum(n) ) %>%
  arrange( desc(Count) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=1 )
```

We find that "James" was the most common baby name.
