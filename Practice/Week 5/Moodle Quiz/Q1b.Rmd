Solution
========

We extract the information using

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## Part a)
Poe <- Poe_raw %>%
  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%
  mutate( word = gsub( "\\_", "", word ) ) 

## Part b)
Poe %>% 
  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>% 
  slice_head(n=5)
```

We find that "the", "of", "and", "to" and "a" are the most common words across the short stories.
