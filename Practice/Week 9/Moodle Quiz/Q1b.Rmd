Question
========
Based on your plot produced for Exercise 1 part b), which of the following statements is true? 

Answerlist
----------

* Most of the swine fever cases are located in the west of the Baltic states.		
* Most of the swine fever cases are located in the east of the Baltic states.
* There are almost no cases in the West of Latvia
* Most cases are located in Latvia



Solution
========

We can produce the map of cases for the Baltic states using the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SwineFever_Baltic <- SwineFever %>%
  filter( country %in% c( "Estonia", "Latvia", "Lithuania" ) )

ggplot( SwineFever_Baltic, aes( x=longitude,y=latitude ) ) +
  annotation_map_tile( zoom=6 ) + geom_spatial_point( ) + 
  labs( x="Longitude", y="Latitude" )
```

From this plot we conclude that most of the cases are located in the east of the Baltic states, with almost no cases observed in the western half of Latvia.
