We can produce the map using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
France <- read_sf( "Shapefiles/gadm41_FRA_2.shp" ) %>% st_simplify( dTolerance = 1000 )

Crime_France <- read.csv( "data/Crimes France.csv", header=TRUE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8" )

France <- inner_join( x=France, y=Crime_France, by=c("NAME_2"="Department") )

ggplot( ) + 
  annotation_map_tile( zoom=6 ) +
  geom_sf( data=France, aes(fill=Violence.per.1000.pop) ) + theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_distiller( palette="Reds", trans="reverse" ) + 
  theme( axis.title=element_text(size=15), axis.text=element_text(size=15) ) + 
  labs( x="Longitude", y="Latitude", color="Violence per 1000 people" )
```

The map shows that the highest violence rates were observed for Paris. High rates were also recorded along the French Riviera, around Paris, and in the northern départments close to the border with Belgium.
