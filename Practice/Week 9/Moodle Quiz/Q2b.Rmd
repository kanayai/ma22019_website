Question
========
Which of the following statements is true when considering the rate of burglaries per 1000 people per départment?


Answerlist
----------

* Burglaries seem to be more common in southern than northern France
* Lyon is a hotspot for burglaries
* The highest rates were observed in and around Paris 
* The rate of burglaries varies between 10 and 20 across départments


Solution
========

We can produce the map using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
France <- read_sf( "Shapefiles/gadm41_FRA_2.shp" ) %>% st_simplify( dTolerance = 1000 )

Crime_France <- read.csv( "Crimes France.csv", header=TRUE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8" )

France <- inner_join( x=France, y=Crime_France, by=c("NAME_2"="Department") )

ggplot( ) + 
  annotation_map_tile( zoom=6 ) +
  geom_sf( data=France, aes(fill=Burglaries.per.1000.pop) ) + theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_distiller( palette="Reds", trans="reverse" ) + 
  theme( axis.title=element_text(size=15), axis.text=element_text(size=15) ) + 
  labs( x="Longitude", y="Latitude", color="Violence per 1000 people" )
```

We find that higher rates of burglaries were observed in southern France, with south-west France and the area around Lyon as the hotspots.
