Answerlist
----------
		
* Belarus

Solution
========

We find the top three countries using the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Outbreaks <- read.csv("Outbreaks.csv")

SwineFever <- filter( Outbreaks, disease == "African swine fever" )

SwineFever %>% 
  count( country, sort=TRUE) %>%
  slice_head( n=3 )
```

We find that the three counties worst affected were Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
