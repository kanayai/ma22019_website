## 1. The Golden Rules of Naming

As a Data Scientist, you will generate hundreds of files. If you name them poorly, you will lose them.

::: {.callout-tip}
## The 3 Principles
1.  **Machine Readable:** No spaces, punctuation, or accents. Use `_` or `-`.
2.  **Human Readable:** Meaningful names. `analysis.R` is bad; `01_data_cleaning.R` is good.
3.  **Sortable:** Use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and numbered prefixes (`01_`, `02_`).
:::

### Examples

| Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|--------|---------|
| `my abstract.docx` | `2025-02-15_abstract.docx` |
| `Joe's Filenames Use Spaces and Punctuation.xlsx` | `joes_filenames_are_constistent.csv` |
| `figure 1.png` | `fig01_scatterplot_height_weight.png` |
| `final_final_v2.R` | `04_model_evaluation.R` |

## 2. Organizing Your Workspace

Whether you are using a university PC (H: Drive) or your own laptop, you need a dedicated home for this course.

**Where should you put it?**
*   **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`
*   **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/`
*   **Mac/Linux:** `~/Documents/MA22019/`

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ WARNING: Is your "Documents" folder synced?
On many Macs (iCloud) and Windows PCs (OneDrive), the **Documents** folder is automatically synced to the cloud.
**Git + Cloud (iCloud/OneDrive) = Data Loss.**

**Check this:**
1.  **Mac:** System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options > Desktop & Documents Folders. If this is ON, **do not save your work in Documents**. Create a folder in your User Home directory instead (e.g., `/Users/yourname/MA22019`).
2.  **Windows:** Check if your Documents has a green tick (OneDrive). If so, make a folder directly on your C: drive (e.g., `C:\MA22019`) to be safe.

### Recommended Folder Structure

We recommend the following structure to handle the **three types of activities** in this course:

```
MA22019/
├── 01_Labs/                  # Weekly Computer Labs (Formative)
│   ├── Week_01_Lab/
│   │   └── Lab_01.Rproj
│   ├── Week_02_Lab/
│   └── ...
│
├── 02_Homework/              # Weekly Homework Questions (Formative)
│   ├── Week_01_HW/
│   │   └── HW_01.Rproj
│   └── ...
│
├── 03_Coursework/            # Assessed Summative Work (Graded)
│   ├── CW_1_Wrangling/       # Coursework 1 Repository (Assessed)
│   └── CW_2_Project/         # Coursework 2 Repository (Assessed)
│
└── 04_Resources/             # Lecture notes, cheat sheets
    ├── ggplot2_cheatsheet.pdf
    └── ...
```

### The Three Activity Types
1.  **Labs (Formative):** These are the exercises we do together in the computer labs. Great for practice.
2.  **Homework (Formative):** Weekly open-ended questions. These help you verify your understanding.
3.  **Coursework (Summative):** These are the **two major assessed** pieces of work. These **MUST** be Git repositories (see [Assignment Workflow](computing-assignments.qmd)). Keep them in `03_Coursework` so you don't accidentally mix them up with your weekly practice files.

## 3. Inside a Project (The "Tidy" Project)

Every time you start a new RStudio Project (e.g., for a Lab or Coursework), use this internal structure:

```
my_project/
├── my_project.Rproj    # RStudio Project file (NEVER delete this)
├── README.md           # Explanation of what this project does
├── data/               # Raw and processed data
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── R/                  # R scripts (if you have complex functions)
├── output/             # Plots, tables, and saved results
└── analysis.qmd        # Your main report/analysis
```

### Why this matters?
1.  **Relative Paths:** You can load data with `read.csv( "data/raw/my_data.csv" )`. This works on your computer, your friend's computer, and the marker's computer.
2.  **Clean Workspace:** `output/` keeps your generated files (which you can delete and regenerate) separate from your source code.
3.  **Sanity:** You know exactly where to find the raw data vs. the cleaned data.
