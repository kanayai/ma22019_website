## How Assignment Submission Works

In this course, you will submit all assignments through GitHub. This mirrors real-world data science workflows where version control is essential.

We streamline this process using **GitHub Classroom** and **RStudio's** built-in tools. You essentially never need to open the terminal.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accept the Assignment

1.  Click the **GitHub Classroom link** provided on Moodle/Course Page.
2.  GitHub will automatically create a private repository for you (e.g., `assignment-1-yourname`).
3.  **Copy the URL** of this new repository from your browser address bar.
    *   *It should look like: `https://github.com/MA22019/assignment-1-yourname`*

### Step 2: Clone into RStudio

**Do not download a ZIP file.** We will connect RStudio directly to the cloud.

::: {.callout-important}
## WHERE TO SAVE? (Critical)
**Do NOT** save this project in OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Cloud sync services corrupt Git repositories.

**Recommendation:** Use your University **H: Drive** (Network mapped drive).
👉 **[Read the H: Drive Setup/Map Guide](setup-university-drive.qmd)**
:::

1.  Open **RStudio**.
2.  Go to `File` > `New Project...`
3.  Choose **Version Control** (the 3rd option).
4.  Choose **Git** (the 1st option).
5.  Paste the **Repository URL** you copied in Step 1.
6.  Click **Create Project**.

*Result: RStudio will download your assignment files and open them automatically.*

### Step 3: The "Edit - Commit" Loop

You should save your work to the "cloud" (GitHub) frequently. Think of this as a super-charged "Save" button.

**The Workflow:**

1.  **Edit:** Work on your `.qmd` file. Write code, analysis, and answers.
2.  **Render:** Click "Render" to ensure your code runs and produces the HTML output.
3.  **Stage (The Checkbox):**
    *   Go to the **Git Pane** in RStudio (usually top-right).
    *   Check the **Staged** box next to the files you changed (e.g., `assignment.qmd`).
4.  **Commit (The Snapshot):**
    *   Click the **Commit** button in the Git Pane.
    *   Write a message in the box: *"Completed Question 1 data cleaning"*.
    *   Click **Commit**.

::: {.callout-important}
## Commit at Least 3 Times!
We expect to see a progression of work in your commits. This helps us:
- Verify the work is yours
- Give partial credit if something breaks
- Provide better feedback
:::

### Step 4: Submit (Push)

Your "Commits" are currently only saved on your *local computer*. To submit them to us, you must **Push**.

1.  In the Git Pane, look for the **Green Up Arrow** (Push).
2.  Click it.
3.  Wait for the message: *"HEAD -> main... set up to track remote branch..."*

**Verification:** Go back to your GitHub repository page in your browser and refresh. You should see your latest commit message and updated files.

## Assignment Repository Structure

Each assignment repository will contain:

```
assignment-name/
├── README.md           # Instructions overview
├── assignment.qmd      # Main file you'll edit
├── data/               # Datasets for the assignment
│   └── dataset.csv
└── .gitignore          # Files to ignore
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Large Datasets
Some assignments require large data files (> 25 MB). These will be available on **Moodle**. Download and place them in the `data/` folder inside your project before running the code.

## What Gets Graded?

### 1. Content (80%)

| What We Look At | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Your `.qmd` file | Your code and written answers |
| Rendered output | Does your code run correctly? |
| Accuracy | Are your answers correct? |
| Completeness | Did you attempt all questions? |

### 2. Workflow Points (20%) - "The 3-Commit Rule"

We grade your professional habits. 

**Requirement:** You **must commit at least 3 times** as you work through the assignment.

| Requirement | Points | What We Check |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Minimum 3 commits** | 10% | We look at your commit history |
| **Final files in repo** | 5% | Both `.qmd` and rendered output on GitHub |
| **Organization** | 5% | Clean repo, meaningful commit messages |

**Why do we require multiple commits?**
1.  **Proves progression**: Shows you worked incrementally, not all at once.
2.  **Enables recovery**: If something breaks, you have earlier working versions.
3.  **Mirrors industry**: Professional developers commit frequently.

## Deadlines and Late Policy

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important!
- **Deadline**: The state of your GitHub repository at the deadline time
- **Late submissions**: 10% penalty per day, up to 3 days
- **After 3 days**: No submissions accepted without prior arrangement
:::

### How to Check Your Submission

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Navigate to your assignment repository
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Your `.qmd` file is there and up to date
   - ✅ All files are committed
   - ✅ Last commit time is before the deadline

## Getting Your Own Copy Started

If you want to work on something **not** from an assignment invite link:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[Create new repository on GitHub] --> B[Clone to your computer]
    B --> C[Add your files]
    C --> D[Commit and push]
    
    style A fill:#202329,color:#fff
    style D fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
```

### Creating a New Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your repository
3. Select "Add a README file"
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Follow the **Clone** steps above to bring it into RStudio.

## Collaboration on Group Projects

For group projects, you'll work together in a shared repository:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    subgraph Shared Repository
        A[Main Branch]
    end
    
    subgraph Team Members
        B[Alice's Computer]
        C[Bob's Computer]
        D[Charlie's Computer]
    end
    
    A <-->|push/pull| B
    A <-->|push/pull| C
    A <-->|push/pull| D
    
    style A fill:#202329,color:#fff
    style B fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
    style C fill:#14C8E1,color:#000
    style D fill:#673AB7,color:#fff
```

### Rules for Group Work

1.  **Pull before you start working**: Use the **Blue Down Arrow** (Pull) in the Git Pane.
2.  **Communicate**: Tell teammates what you're working on.
3.  **Commit frequently**: Smaller commits are easier to merge.
4.  **Push when done**: Don't leave changes on your computer.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Git Pane in RStudio"
*   Did you skip Step 2? You must create a **New Project > Version Control**. You cannot just "Open File".
*   Try `Tools > Project Options > Git/SVN` and ensure "Version control system" is set to "Git".

### "Push Failed" (Login Errors)
*   GitHub no longer accepts regular passwords. 
*   If RStudio asks for a username/password:
    *   **Username:** Your GitHub username.
    *   **Password:** You must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. 
    *   *See the [Setup Guide/Git Guide](computing-git.qmd) for generating a PAT.*

### "Merge Conflict"
*   This rarely happens in individual assignments unless you edit files on two different computers.
*   If you see `<<<<<<< HEAD`, ask a TA for help immediately. Don't panic!
