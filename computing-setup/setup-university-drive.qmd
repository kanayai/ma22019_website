# Where to Save Your Project for this Course

When working on course assignments, **where** you save your files is as important as **what** you write.

::: {.callout-important}
## CRITICAL: Avoid OneDrive for Git Projects
**Do not** save your RStudio Projects or Git repositories in your OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive folders.

**Why?**
Cloud sync services (like OneDrive) and Git fight for control over your files.

1.  Git creates thousands of tiny hidden files in `.git/`.
2.  OneDrive tries to sync them instantly.
3.  **Result:** "Corrupt Index" errors, "Fatal" Git crashes, and potential loss of your project history.

**The Solution:** Use your **H: Drive** (University Network Drive).
:::

## The H: Drive Advantage

Your **H: Drive** (`\\myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk\username`) is a personal network storage space provided by the specific University.

*   ✅ **Persistent:** Accessible from any campus PC and your personal laptop.
*   ✅ **Backed Up:** University IT backs it up regularly.
*   ✅ **Git-Safe:** It behaves like a standard hard drive, avoiding OneDrive sync conflicts.

## 1. On Campus (Windows Lab PCs)
When you log in to a University computer, your H: Drive should be mapped automatically.

1.  Open **File Explorer** (Win+E).
2.  Click **This PC** in the left sidebar.
3.  Look for a drive labelled **(H:)** under "Network Locations".
4.  **Action:** Create a folder here named `MA22019` to store all your work.

## 2. Remote Access (Personal Laptop)
To access your H: Drive from your own laptop (at home or in the library), you must be connected to the University network.

### Step A: Connect to VPN (Required)
You generally cannot see university drives from the public internet. You must use the VPN (Virtual Private Network).

*   **Action:** Download and install the GlobalProtect VPN client from the [University of Bath VPN Guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/setting-up-vpn-on-your-device/).
*   **Verify:** Ensure the VPN shows "Connected" before proceeding.

### Step B: Map the Drive
Select the instructions for your Operating System:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Windows
1.  Ensure VPN is connected.
2.  Open **File Explorer**.
3.  Right-click on **This PC** (left sidebar) > **Map network drive...**
4.  **Drive:** Select **H:** from the dropdown.
5.  **Folder:** Type `\\myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk\username` (replace `username` with your username, e.g., `abc123`).
6.  Check **Connect using different credentials**.
7.  Click **Finish**.
8.  **Credentials:**
    *   **User:** `CAMPUS\username` (e.g., `CAMPUS\abc123`)
    *   **Password:** Your university password.

## macOS
1.  Ensure VPN is connected.
2.  Open **Finder**.
3.  In the menu bar, click **Go** > **Connect to Server...** (or press `Cmd+K`).
4.  **Server Address:** Type `smb://myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk/username` (replace `username` with your username).
5.  Click **Connect**.
6.  **Credentials:**
    *   Select "Registered User".
    *   **Name:** `username` (or `CAMPUS\username` if that fails)
    *   **Password:** Your university password.

## Linux (Ubuntu/GNOME)
1.  Ensure VPN is connected.
2.  Open **File Manager (Nautilus)**.
3.  Click **Other Locations** in the sidebar.
4.  **Connect to Server:** Type `smb://myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk/username` (replace `username` with your username).
5.  Click **Connect**.
6.  **Credentials:**
    *   **Domain:** `CAMPUS`
    *   **Username:** Your username
    *   **Password:** Your university password.

## 3. Web Access (files.bath) - Emergency Only!

You may discover **files.bath.ac.uk** (WebDrive).

*   ❌ **Do NOT use this for your RStudio Project.**
*   **Why?** RStudio cannot "see" files inside a web browser. You cannot run code, save plots, or use Git directly from this website.
*   **Use Case:** Only use `files.bath` if you forgot your laptop and need to quickly download a single file to a public or shared computer.

---

---

## 5. What about the W: Drive (WebDrive)?

You may also see a **W: Drive** (`\\waltz.campus.bath.ac.uk\wwwgroup`).

*   ⚠️ **DANGER:** This is your **Personal Web Space**.
*   **Public Risk:** Files you save here may be visible to the entire world on the internet.
*   **Coursework:**
    *   **NEVER** save your RStudio projects or homework solutions here.
    *   **WHY?** If your solution is google-able, you could be flagged for Academic Misconduct (collusion/sharing solutions).
    *   **Only** use this drive if you are explicitly asked to host a final HTML webpage.

## 6. Cloning into H: Drive
When you follow "Step 2: Clone to Your Computer" in the [Assignment Workflow](computing-assignments.qmd):

1.  In RStudio > New Project > Version Control > Git...
2.  **Create project as subdirectory of:** Click **Browse...**
3.  Navigate to your **H: Drive**.
    *   *Windows:* Select `H:\MA22019`.
    *   *Mac:* Select the mounted server drive from the sidebar.
4.  Click **Create Project**.

Your code is now safe, backed up, and accessible from anywhere!
