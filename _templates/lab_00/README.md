# Lab 00: The Setup Check

Welcome to your first MA22019 lab! This repository helps you verify that your Git workflow is set up correctly.

## What's Inside

- `lab_00.qmd` — The main Quarto document you'll be working with
- `lab_00.Rproj` — RStudio project file (double-click to open)
- `check_location.R` — A helper script to verify you cloned to the right place

## What You'll Learn

By completing this lab, you will:

1. Understand the difference between **Save** (local) and **Push** (cloud)
2. Practice the **Stage → Commit → Push** cycle
3. Render your first Quarto report

## What Makes a Good README?

Every project should have a `README.md` that answers these questions:

1. **What is this?** — A one-sentence description of the project
2. **What's inside?** — A quick list of important files
3. **How do I use it?** — Setup or usage instructions
4. **Who made it?** — Author and contact info (optional)

Keep it short and scannable. Use headings, bullet points, and code blocks to make it easy to read.
