Subject: MA22019: Ready for Week 1 (Tutor Setup & Feedback)

Hi everyone,

To start the semester smoothly, I would like you to "beta test" the student experience before labs start.

1. SETUP & FEEDBACK (Priority)
Please go through the Student Setup Guide as if you were a student.
Link: https://kanayai.github.io/ma22019_website/computing_setup/setup.html

- Please follow the steps exactly (installing software, verifying location, etc.).
- Feedback Request: If you find anything unclear or hit any issues, please let me know! Your feedback helps me refine this for the students.

2. YOUR TEST REPOSITORY
Part of the setup involves cloning a personal repo. Use your specific one:
https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/lab-00-yourusername

Action: Setup the project structure as described in the guide (using a 'practice' folder).
- Crucial: Ensure you do NOT clone this inside the 'materials' folder!

3. LOGIN REQUIREMENT (Critical)
Some of you (jh3671 specifically) may get a "404 Not Found" error when visiting the link above.
- Reason: You have not logged in to the GitHub Enterprise server yet.
- Fix: Log in to https://github.bath.ac.uk once. Then reply to let me know, and I will add you immediately.

4. TUTORIAL SCHEDULE
Please reply to this email with the day and time of your assigned tutorial group (if you know it). This will help me finalize the roster.

Thanks for your help!

Best,
Karim
