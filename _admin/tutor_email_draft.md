**Subject:** MA22019: Ready for Week 1 (Tutor Setup)

Hi everyone,

To start the semester smoothly, we have set up personal "Student View" repositories for each of you. This allows you to experience exactly what the students will see this week.

### 1. Your Test Repository
You can find your personal Lab 00 repo here:
`https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/lab-00-yourusername`

**Action:** Please clone this into a folder named `MA22019/practice/`.
*   We are telling students to use a `practice` folder to avoid cluttering their root directory.
*   **Do not** clone this (or any student repo) inside the `materials` folder!

### 2. Login Requirement (Important!)
Some of you (`jh3671` specifically) may get a **404 Not Found** error when visiting the link above.
*   **Reason:** You have not logged in to the GitHub Enterprise server yet, so we couldn't add you to the repo.
*   **Fix:** Log in to [github.bath.ac.uk](https://github.bath.ac.uk) once. Then reply to let us know, and we will add you immediately.

### 3. Review the Guides
We have updated the internal [Tutor Guide](https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/ma22019_website/blob/main/_admin/tutor_guide.md) with instructions on how to clone student work safely (avoiding the "repo-inside-a-repo" trap).

Thanks for your help!

Best,
MA22019 Team
