## Step-by-Step Marking

1.  **Find your students**:
    *   The instructor will send you a list of usernames.
    *   Go to: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026`
    *   Search for `hw_01-{username}`.

2.  **Check Submission Time**:
    *   Look at the "Last commit" timestamp on the file list.
    *   If it is after the deadline, note it (but mark it anyway for Homework).

3.  **Review the Code**:
    *   Open `hw_01.qmd`.
    *   Does code look correct?
    *   Did they answer the reflection question?

4.  **Provide Feedback (The Issue)**:
    *   Click **Issues** tab (top of repo).
    *   Click **New Issue**.
    *   Title: `Homework 1 Feedback`
    *   Paste the template below and fill it out.
    *   Click **Submit new issue**.
