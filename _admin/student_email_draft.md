**Subject:** MA22019: Urgent Setup Instructions for Week 1

Dear Students,

Welcome to MA22019!

We are using a professional software stack this semester (R, RStudio, and GitHub Enterprise). To ensure you are ready for the first lab on Monday, please complete the following **two items** this weekend.

### 1. Log in to GitHub (CRITICAL)
Your personal course repositories have been created, but you cannot access them until you log in.
*   **Action:** Go to [https://github.bath.ac.uk](https://github.bath.ac.uk) and log in with your university username/password.
*   **Deadline:** Please do this **immediately**. If you don't, you will get a "404 Not Found" error in the lab.

### 2. Complete the Setup Guide
We have prepared a step-by-step guide to installing the required software.
*   **Action:** Read and follow the [Computing Setup Guide](https://kanayai.github.io/ma22019_website/computing_setup/setup.html).
*   **Time required:** ~20-30 minutes.
*   **Important:** You will create a folder called `MA22019/practice` and clone your lab there. Do not put it inside `materials`!

### What to expect on Monday
When you arrive at the lab, you will check two things to confirm you are ready:
1.  Can you access the course materials? (https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/materials)
2.  Can you see your personal repository? (https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/lab-00-yourusername)

If you have completed the steps above, both links will work perfectly.

See you in the lab!

Best regards,
MA22019 Teaching Team
