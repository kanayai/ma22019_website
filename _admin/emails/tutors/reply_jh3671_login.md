Subject: Re: Github Login

Hi there,

Thanks for logging in!

I have just triggered the setup script. You should now be able to access your personal repo here:
https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/lab-00-jh3671

Please try cloning it (remember: **outside** the materials folder!) and let me know if it works.

Best,
Karim
