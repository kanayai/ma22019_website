# MA22019: Pre-Lab 0 To-Do List

**Subject**: MA22019: Your Pre-Lab Checklist (Get Ready for Lab 0!)

Hi everyone,

Lab 0 is our "Setup & Launch" session. To ensure a smooth start, please go through this checklist before your first lab session.

### ✅ MUST DO (Everyone)
- [ ] **Read the Setup Guide**: This is your primary instruction manual. It is available on Moodle (or in the materials repo once cloned).
- [ ] **Create a GitHub Account**: Go to [github.bath.ac.uk](https://github.bath.ac.uk) and sign in with your university credentials.
- [ ] **Know Your Password**: Make sure you know your university password (you will need it to log in).

### 💻 IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR OWN LAPTOP (Recommended)
- [ ] **Install R**: Download it from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org).
- [ ] **Install RStudio**: Download the "RStudio Desktop" from [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- [ ] **Install Quarto**: Download it from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org).
- [ ] **Install Git**:
    - **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    - **Mac**: Open Terminal and type `git --version`. If it asks to install, say yes.
- [ ] **Verify**: Open RStudio and check that you can see the "Git" tab in the top right pane (or go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN).

### 🏛️ IF YOU ARE USING A LAB COMPUTER
- [ ] **Bring Headphones**: (Optional) If you want to watch any video guides during the session.
- [ ] **Log In Early**: allow 5-10 minutes for the PC to log you in if it's your first time.

### 🐢 IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANY OF THE ABOVE
- [ ] **Don't Panic**: Just show up to the lab. We will help you.
- [ ] **Be Patient**: It might take a bit longer to get started, but we'll get you there.

---

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The "One Command" Check
In Lab 0, **after you clone the course materials** (see Setup Guide), you will run this command in RStudio:
`source("check_location.R")`

This is our new magic wand 🪄 that tells you if you are in the right folder or not. It saves 99% of the headaches!

See you in the lab!

Best,
The MA22019 Team
