**Subject:** MA22019: Getting Ready for Week 1

Dear Students,

Welcome to MA22019!

I am very excited to start this journey into Data Science with you. This course is designed to be hands-on and practical, giving you the real-world tools used by data scientists today.

We will be using a professional software stack this semester (R, RStudio, and GitHub Enterprise).

### 1. Computer Setup & Lab 0
I know it is the weekend, so please do not feel obliged to do any work now!

Important Note: Unlike other modules, Lab 0 is NOT on Moodle. Instead, you will access it by following our [Computing Setup Guide](https://kanayai.github.io/ma22019_website/computing_setup/setup.html).
*(If asked for a password, please use your standard University of Bath credentials.)*

If you want to get a head start, you are welcome to try the Setup Guide now. However, if you prefer to relax this weekend (which is fully encouraged!), don't worry! We will go through the guide together in the lab to ensure everyone gets set up and can access Lab 0 comfortably.

### 2. Using Your Own Laptop
If you prefer to work on your own machine, please bring it to every session — this includes lectures as well as labs!
*   We will frequently do "Live Coding" demos in lectures where you can code along with me.
*   (For the interactive Mentimeter quizzes we'll do, your phone is actually the best tool, so keep that handy too!)

### 3. Schedule Reminder
*   Labs/Tutorials: Start this week (Monday 2 Feb or Tuesday 3 Feb, depending on your tutorial group).
*   Lectures: The first lecture is on Wednesday 4 Feb.
    *   (Yes, we start with labs before the lecture — this is intentional! It's a chance to get your computer ready.)

See you all on Monday!

Best regards,

Dr. Karim Anaya-Izquierdo
MA22019 Lecturer

## Option 2: Moodle Forum / Plain Text
*Safe for plain text forms where formatting might break.*
