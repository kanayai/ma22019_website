This folder is wiped when you log off or switch computers.\n\nThe Fix: Keep the install_packages.R script handy! You may need to run it again at the start of a session if your packages are missing.\n\n“Rtools is Missing” Warning: When running the install script, you might see a scary red warning about Rtools not being installed.\n\nThe Fix: Ignore it. Rtools is for compiling packages from source. We use pre-built binaries, so you don’t need it. As long as you see Setup Complete at the end, you are fine!",
