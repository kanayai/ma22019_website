Question
========
When considering a corpus which only includes *Moby Dick* and *The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe*, which five words have the highest term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf)?

Answerlist
----------
* ahab
* farther
* friday
* labour
* sperm
* starbuck
* stubb
* whale


Solution
========

We can use the bind_tf_idf() function as seen in the Section 4.3.2:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Books %>%
  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>% 
  mutate( word = gsub( "_", "", word ) ) %>% 
  count( title, word, sort=TRUE ) %>%
  bind_tf_idf( word, title, n ) %>%
  arrange( desc(tf_idf) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=10 )
```

The output shows that "whale", "ahab", "friday", "sperm" and "stubb" have the highest term frequency - inverse document frequency. Here we ignore the word "whales" because it's the plural of a word with higher tf-idf.
