Question
========
Which plane (specified by the **tailnum** variable) departed most often from New York City airports in 2013?


Solution
========
The plan with tail number N725MQ departed the most often from the New York City airports. We may use group_by() and summarise(), but now also order the planes according to their number flights, since the data contain information for a large number of planes:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
NYCFlights %>%
  group_by( tailnum ) %>%
  summarize( Number_of_Flights=n() ) %>%
  arrange( desc(Number_of_Flights) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=5 )
```
We have to ignore the first entry, because **NA** does not refer to a single plane.
