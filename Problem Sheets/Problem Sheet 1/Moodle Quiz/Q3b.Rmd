Solution
========
We find that between 1965 and 2016 there were a larger number of earthquakes in the southern than in the northern hemisphere.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Earthquakes %>% 
  mutate( Hemisphere = case_when( Latitude>=0 ~ "North",
                                  Latitude< 0 ~ "South" ) ) %>%
  group_by( Hemisphere ) %>%
  summarize( "Number_Earthquakes" = n() )
```
