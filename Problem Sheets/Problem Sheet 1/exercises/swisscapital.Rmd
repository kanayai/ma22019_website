Question
========
Which issue with the raw data may be addressed by using the as_date() function? 


Answerlist
----------
* Variable names are uninformative;
* Data types are incompatible with available R functions;
* We are only interested in a subset of the data.



Solution
========
The function as_date() converts a variable of type character into a variable of type Date. Therefore, it is useful when we are working with dates and the function we want to use requires that the variable is of type Date, i.e., it addresses the second issue. 

Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False

Solution
========
 The function as_numeric() converts a variable of type character into a variable of type numeric. This function is useful when we read data as character but actually need to use it for calculations, i.e., it again addresses the second issue.
