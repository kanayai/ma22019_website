Solution
========

We first calculate the counts for each name:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Names_Girls <- Babies %>%
  filter( sex=="F" ) %>%
  group_by( name ) %>%
  summarize( Count=sum(n) )
```

Using the code in Section 3.1.2, we create a word cloud as follows:

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
Names_Girls %>% with( wordcloud( name, Count, max.words=30 ) )
```

We find that Mary was the most popular name over the period, as it has the largest font size.
