Question
========
In which decade did the popularity of the name "Mary" peak?

Answerlist
----------
* 1880-1889
* 1920-1929
* 1950-1959
* 1980-1989


Solution
========

One way is to create a plot for the proportions over time:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Babies %>% 
  filter( sex=="F", name=="Mary" ) %>%
  ggplot( aes("x"=year, "y"=prop) ) + geom_line( linewidth=1 ) + 
  labs( x="Year", y="Proportion of newborn girls named Mary" ) + theme_bw()
```

From the plot, we conclude that "Mary" has become less popular over the period, falling from a peak of more than 7% in 1880 to 0.1-0.2% in the 2010s. SO the correct answer is 1880-1889.
