----------
* ship

* body

Solution
========

Using the data from part a), we first remove the stop words in the list provided by the tidytext package:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data( stop_words )
Poe <- Poe %>% anti_join( stop_words, by="word" )
```

Finally, we apply the count() function again, but we need to do it for each story. So we combine count() with group_by():

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Poe %>%
  group_by( story ) %>%
  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>% 
  slice_head( n=1 )
```
