Question
========
When sightings of Type Ia supernova, which type of spatial data (point-referenced, point pattern or lattice/areal data) are mostly likely working with?

Answerlist
----------
		
* Point-referenced
* Point pattern
* Lattice/areal

Solution
========

The locations of Type Ia supernova are unknown and we thus will have point pattern data. 

This is one application of spatial data analysis which does not consider observations located on earth. This results in a coordinate system different to the latitude/longitude system considered in most examples.
