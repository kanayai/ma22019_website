When considering air pollution levels across a city, which type of spatial data (point-referenced, point pattern or lattice/areal data) are mostly likely working with?

Answerlist
----------
		
* Point-referenced
* Point pattern
* Lattice/areal

Solution
========

We may have information from measurement stations across the city. The locations of the measurement stations will be known and our variable of interest is the concentration of pollutants. Consequently, we have point-referenced data.
