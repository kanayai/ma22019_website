Question
========
When using inverse distance weighting with $p=2$ for the New Zealand precipitation data, what is the predicted value at 166°E Longitude and 51°S Latitude?

Solution
========

The main challenge is to identify that we have to consider the negative for the latitude, because the point lies in the southern hemisphere:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rain  <- read.csv( "NewZealandRain.csv" )
coord <- cbind( Rain$lon, Rain$lat )
IDW( X=Rain$precipitation, S=coord, s_star=c(166,-51), p=2.0 )
```

We find that the predicted value (to 2 decimal places) is $225.48$mm.
