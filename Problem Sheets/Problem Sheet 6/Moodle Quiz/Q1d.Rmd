Question
========
When considering the damage caused by the great spruce bark beetle across Western England, which type of spatial data (point-referenced, point pattern or lattice/areal data) are mostly likely working with?

Answerlist
----------
		
* Point-referenced
* Point pattern
* Lattice/areal

Solution
========

It is not feasible to investigate each individual tree. Instead, we will be given information on whether a woodland area is affected by the bark beetle or not. This would result in lattice / areal data.
