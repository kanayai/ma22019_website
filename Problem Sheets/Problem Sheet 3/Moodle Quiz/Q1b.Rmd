Solution
========

To identify of the UK economy which produced the most CO$_2$ emissions, we can use functions from dplyr:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
CO2_UK <- CO2 %>%
  filter( country=="UK" ) %>%
  group_by( sector ) %>%
  summarize( Total=sum(emissions) )
CO2_UK
```

We find that ground transport is the corect answer.
