Question
========
Identify the date for which the difference in recorded daily minimum and maximum temperatures was at its highest in 2019. Enter your answer in the Day/Month format via the quiz on Moodle.

Solution
========
We first create a new variable which represents the difference in minimum and maximum temperature on the day and then find the day with the largest difference:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
NYC <- read.csv( "NYC Weather 2019.csv" )
NYC %>% 
  mutate( Difference = Tmax - Tmin ) %>%
  arrange( desc(Difference) ) %>%
  slice_head( n=1 )
```

We find that the correct answer is 08/04.
