## What Gets Graded (Coursework)

### 1. Content (80%)

| What We Look At | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Your `.qmd` file | Your code and written answers |
| Rendered output | Does your code run correctly? |
| Accuracy | Are your answers correct? |
| Completeness | Did you attempt all questions? |

### 2. Workflow Points (20%) — "The 3-Commit Rule"

We grade your professional habits. 

**Requirement:** You **must commit at least 3 times** as you work through the assignment.

| Requirement | Points | What We Check |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Minimum 3 commits** | 10% | We look at your commit history |
| **Final files in repo** | 5% | Both `.qmd` and rendered output on GitHub |
| **Organization** | 5% | Clean repo, meaningful commit messages |

**Why do we require multiple commits?**

1.  **Proves progression**: Shows you worked incrementally, not all at once.
2.  **Enables recovery**: If something breaks, you have earlier working versions.
3.  **Mirrors industry**: Professional developers commit frequently.
