## 📝 File Naming Convention & Policies

- **Allowed Formats**: `.qmd` (preferred), `.R`, `.md`
- **Naming**: All files/folders use **snake_case** (e.g., `week_1`, `lab_1.qmd`)
- **Slides**: `NN_descriptive_name.qmd` (e.g., `01_data_cleaning_and_wrangling.qmd`)
- **Underscore prefix (`_`)**: Ignored by Quarto (e.g., `_Coursework 1`, `_admin`)

## 📦 Data Management

**Large data files are hosted on OneDrive and symlinked into the project.**
(Note: The `materials` folder in the root is NOT the `ma22019-materials` repo. It simulates the student experience of cloning the separate materials repo).

### Symlink Architecture

The project uses symlinks extensively to avoid storing large data files in Git:

| Component | Symlink Location | Points To |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Central data | `assets/data/` | OneDrive `.../MA22019 Lecture Notes/Data` |
| Lecture notes | `lecture_notes/Data` | OneDrive `.../MA22019 Lecture Notes/Data` |
| Slides | `slides/data` | `../assets/data` (relative) |
| Case studies | `case_studies/data` | `../assets/data` (relative) |
| Practice weeks | `practice/week_X/data` | OneDrive `.../Practice/Week X/data` |
| Live coding | `live_coding/week_X/Data` | OneDrive `.../LIve Coding/LIve Coding X/Data` |
| Coursework | `Coursework/_Coursework X/data` | OneDrive `.../Coursework/Coursework X/data` |

### Important Rules

1. **Do not commit data files directly** - Always place them in the OneDrive folder
2. **Git tracks the symlinks**, not the data content
3. **OneDrive is the primary backup** for all data files
4. See **[SYNC_WORKFLOW.md](SYNC_WORKFLOW.md)** for multi-machine setup

## 🔧 Building the Website

### Full Render
```bash
quarto render
```
Renders the entire site. Output goes to `_site/`.

### Development Workflow (Recommended)

For day-to-day editing, use the **live preview server**:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This starts a live development server that:
- Opens your browser automatically
- **Watches for file changes** — when you save a `.qmd` file, it re-renders just that file
- **Auto-refreshes** your browser with the changes
- Much faster than full `quarto render`

### Render a Single File
```bash
quarto render "practice/week_3/lab_3.qmd"
```

### Freeze Cache
The project uses `_freeze/` to cache rendered output. On subsequent renders, unchanged files are skipped automatically.

## 🚀 Publishing the Website

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages (Enterprise).

### Manual Publish (Recommended)
Because valid HTML output is hidden in `_site/` (gitignored), we use the Quarto publish command to deploy:

```bash
quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser
```

This command:
1.  Renders the site
2.  Commits the output to the `gh-pages` branch
3.  Pushes to GitHub

## 🎓 Release Workflow

### Solutions
Solutions are in `_solutions/` (ignored by Quarto). To release:
1. Move the solution file from `_solutions/` to `practice/week_X/`
2. Re-render the site
3. Commit and push

### Coursework
Coursework folders prefixed with `_` are ignored. To release:
1. Rename `_Coursework X` to `Coursework X`
2. Update `coursework.qmd` with listing
3. Re-render, commit, push

### Assignment Deployment Strategy (ma22019_tools)

We use the custom `ma22019_tools` R package to manage assignment distribution.

1.  **Student Repos (The Deliverable)**:
    *   Repositories like `lab_00-username` or `hw_01-username` on GitHub.
    *   These are created from template repositories using `ma22019_tools`.

2.  **`_templates/` Folder (Website Copy)**:
    *   Located inside this project (`ma22019_website/_templates/`).
    *   **Purpose**: "Golden Master" for rendering instructions on the course website.

3.  **Why NOT in `materials`?**:
    *   The `materials` repository is **read-only** for students (Labs/Notes only).
    *   Assignments are personal repositories.

## 🔐 Grading & Identity Verification

This course uses **GitHub Enterprise** (`github.bath.ac.uk`), which strictly enforces University Single Sign-On (SSO).

*   **Source of Truth**: Grading is linked to the **Repository Name** (e.g., `lab-00-username`), which is tied to the student's authenticated University account.
*   **Git Author Mismatch**: If a student forgets to configure their local `git config` and pushes as "DarkLord99", it **does not matter**. The work is still securely inside the `username` repository, and the Pushed By event on GitHub Enterprise confirms their identity.
*   **No Manual Tracking**: Tutors do NOT need to maintain a mapping of "Real Name" vs "Git Name". Trust the repository username.

## 🖥️ Setup on a New Machine

**Crucial: Read [SYNC_WORKFLOW.md](SYNC_WORKFLOW.md) first!**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/ma22019_website.git
cd ma22019_website

# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull --prune

# 2. Clean up any old untracked folders
git clean -fd

# 3. Ensure OneDrive is running and symlinks work
ls -F assets/data/

# 4. Preview the site
quarto preview
```

### If Symlinks Are Broken

Recreate the primary symlink:
```bash
ln -sf "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/OneDrive - University of Bath/Teaching/MA22019/from Christian/MA22019 Lecture Notes/Data" assets/data
```
