They also managed to provide us with access to some data for the houses in Utopia. We are asked to use the data to address the following questions:\n\n1) For each cause, explore how the frequency of fires varied across the time of day.\n\n2) Are there any differences in the risk of fire for the different types of property? \n\n3) What is the relation between the year a property was built and the risk of fire?\n\nWe will explore how we can apply the techniques seen so far to address the three questions. \n\n\n## Data Descriptions\n\nWe are provided with two data files for the analysis:\n\n**Data/Fires.csv**: List of fires recorded by the Utopian Fire Department for 2022\n\n* **Date**: Day and time the fire was reported\n\n* **Cause**: Cause the fire was attributed to (\"Cooking\", \"Electrical Fault\", \"Heating\" or \"Other\")\n\n* **RegisterNumber**: Identification number of the property as listed in the register of houses/properties\n\n**Data/Housing Register.csv:** Register of houses/properties for Utopia at the beginning of 2022\n\n* **ID**: Identification number of the property\n\n* **Year**: Year the property was built\n\n* **Type**: Type of property (\"Flat\", \"Terraced\", \"Semi-detached\" or \"Detached\")\n\n* **Bedroom**: Number of bedrooms (studio apartments are counted as having 1 bedroom)\n\n\n## Number of fires over time\n\nWe start by loading the data set \"Data/Fires.csv\" and converting the variable **Date** to the correct type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFires <- read.csv(\"data/fires.csv\" )\nFires <- Fires %>% mutate( Date = ymd_hm( Date ) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse( Fires )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 33,118\nColumns: 3\n$ Date           <dttm> 2022-01-01 00:11:00, 2022-01-01 00:34:00, 2022-01-01 1…\n$ Cause          <chr> \"Cooking\", \"Electrical Fault\", \"Other\", \"Heating\", \"Hea…\n$ RegisterNumber <int> 8557338, 7861834, 4013959, 1640021, 3688588, 5304925, 8…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Task 1:** Create a facet plot, where each subplot provides a histogram of the number of fires per hour of the day for a different cause.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot( Fires, aes( x=hour(Date) ) ) + \n  geom_histogram( bins=24 ) + coord_polar() + \n  facet_wrap( ~Cause ) + labs( x=\"Hour of the Day\", y=\"Number of Fires\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](analysis_of_fire_data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Task 2:** What do you conclude from your plot produced in Task 1?\n\n\n## Fire risk across type of property\n\nWe now move onto analyzing the risk of fire.\n\n**Task 3:** How would you define \"risk of fire\" in this context?\n\nOne way is to consider the proportion of properties that reported fire amongst a subset of\nproperties.\n\n\nLet's load the data from the housing register and combine the two data sets\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nHouses    <- read.csv( \"Data/Housing Register.csv\" )\nFire_Risk <- full_join( Fires, Houses, by=c(\"RegisterNumber\"=\"ID\") )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(Fire_Risk)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 3,472,972\nColumns: 6\n$ Date           <dttm> 2022-01-01 00:11:00, 2022-01-01 00:34:00, 2022-01-01 1…\n$ Cause          <chr> \"Cooking\", \"Electrical Fault\", \"Other\", \"Heating\", \"Hea…\n$ RegisterNumber <int> 8557338, 7861834, 4013959, 1640021, 3688588, 5304925, 8…\n$ Year           <int> 2002, 1996, 1963, 1938, 1960, 1974, 1927, 1946, 1989, 2…\n$ Type           <chr> \"Terraced\", \"Terraced\", \"Terraced\", \"Terraced\", \"Terrac…\n$ Bedrooms       <int> 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFire_Risk[1000000,]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        Date Cause RegisterNumber Year     Type Bedrooms\n1000000 <NA>  <NA>        2811652 1951 Terraced        1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Task 4:** Create a variable to indicate whether a house was affected by a fire in 2022 or not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFire_Risk <- Fire_Risk %>%\n  mutate( Fire = case_when( is.na(Date) == TRUE ~ 0, is.na(Date) == FALSE ~ 1 ) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Task 5:** For each type of property, calculate the proportion of properties which reported a fire in 2022.
