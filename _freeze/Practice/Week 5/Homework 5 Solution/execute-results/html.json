Exercises 1-3 are designed to help you with revising the content of the lecture from Week 5. You can check your solutions to these questions yourself by answering the Moodle quiz.\n\nTutorial Question 1 is similar to Exercises 1-3, while Tutorial Question 2 explores how well the type of sentiment analysis we introduced performs at assessing sentiment for product reviews. Should time permit, you may want to work on the Homework Question during the tutorial. \n\nYour answer to the Homework Question can be submitted on Moodle to your tutor for feedback. The submission deadline is 17:00 on Thursday 13 March 2025. You should submit a single PDF or Word file that provides your R code, any created R output and all your comments.\n\nYou may want to load the following packages before starting the exercise:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary( dplyr )\nlibrary( ggplot2 )\nlibrary( tidytext )\nlibrary( wordcloud )\nlibrary( stringr )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen working on a University PC, you have to first install the tidytext and wordcloud packages. The installation of the textdata package is quite cumbersome, and thus I provide the AFINN and Bing sentiment lexicons as .csv files for your convenience. You can load them using\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAFINN <- read.csv( \"data/AFINN Sentiment Lexicon.csv\" )\nBing <- read.csv( \"data/Bing Sentiment Lexicon.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **Exercise 1 - Short stories by Edgar Allan Poe**\n\nThe file \"Poe.csv\" contains the book *The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - Volume 1* which includes eight short stories by the American author Edgar Allen Poe. Each row in the data set gives a line from the book and the name of the short story that line belongs to. To load the data, we use\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPoe_raw <- read.csv( \"data/Poe.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe following exercises are designed to help you with revising the steps we used for extracting the most common words for *Jane Eyre* in the lecture.\n\na) Extract the individual words from the text and remove any underscores.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *Looking at Section 3.1.2, we identify that we need to use unnest_tokens() and gsub():*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPoe <- Poe_raw %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub( \"\\\\_\", \"\", word ) ) \n```\n:::\n\n\nb) Which are the five most common words (including stop words) across all stories?\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We apply the count() function we used for calculating the term frequency in Section 3.1.2 and output the five words with the highest count:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPoe %>% \n  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>% \n  slice_head(n=5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  word    n\n1  the 6585\n2   of 3788\n3  and 2112\n4   to 2055\n5    a 1890\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We find that \"the\", \"of\", \"and\", \"to\" and \"a\" are the most common words across the short stories.*</p>\n\n\nc) For each short story, identify the word most commonly used within it (excluding stop words).\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We first remove the stop words in the list provided by the tidytext package:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata( stop_words )\nPoe <- Poe %>% anti_join( stop_words, by=\"word\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *Finally, we apply the count() function again, but we need to do it for each story.

The file \"LesMis.csv\" contains the data as provided by Project Gutenberg, but with the metadata at the beginning and end already removed. Consider the following questions:\n\na) Extract the individual words from the text, and remove any stop words and underscores.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We adapt the code from the lectures and use the functions unnest_tokens(), gsub() and anti_join():*</p>\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLesMis_raw <- read.csv( \"data/LesMis.csv\", fileEncoding=\"UTF-8\" )\ndata( stop_words )\n\nLesMis <- LesMis_raw %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub( \"\\\\_\", \"\", word ) )  %>% \n  anti_join( stop_words, by=\"word\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nb) Find the 10 most common in *Les Misérables* (excluding stop words) and create a bar plot which visualizes their number of occurrences.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We first create a data frame that gives the number of times each word appeared in the text and we sort the words based on this count*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLesMis_Count <- LesMis %>% count( word, sort=TRUE )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We now extract and reorder the top 10 words before creating a bar plot as in Section 3.1.2 of the lecture notes:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLesMis_Count %>%\n  slice_head( n=10 ) %>%\n  mutate( word = reorder(word,n) ) %>%\n  ggplot( aes( x=n, y=word) ) + geom_col() + \n  theme_bw() + labs( x=\"Count\", y=\"\" ) +\n  theme( axis.text=element_text(size=17), axis.title=element_text(size=17) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-5-Solution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We find that the four most frequent words (excluding stop words) refer to three of the protagonists in the book. We also see that the word \"chapter\" appears very often. This finding results from the chapter titles being labeled \"Chapter..\" and thus this is not really accurate (the book also provides a table of contents that uses \"chapter\" a lot).*</p>\n\nc) Create a word cloud for the 30 most frequently used words (excluding stop words).\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We adapt the code from Section 3.1.2 in the lecture notes:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLesMis_Count %>% with( wordcloud( word, n, max.words=30 ) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-5-Solution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We again see that the 30 most common words include the main characters and the city of Paris, where most of the story takes place. The remaining words are hard to group within a single theme.*</p>\n\n\n### **Tutorial Question 2 - Amazon Reviews** \n\nOne important application area for sentiment analysis concerns the analysis of customer reviews. To explore how good the AFINN lexicon performs at capturing the overall sentiment of a review, we consider 1,000 Amazon product reviews. The data is stored in the file “AmazonReviews.csv”.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nReviews_raw <- read.csv( \"data/AmazonReviews.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data provides the rating (\"1 Star\" to \"5 Stars\") and the accompanying text for each review. We want to derive the sentiment for each review and then compare it to the given score to assess how well we perform at capturing the sentiment of the text.\n\na) Using the AFINN sentiment lexicon, for each review, calculate the average sentiment per word.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We start by splitting the reviews into individual words:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nReviews <- Reviews_raw %>% unnest_tokens( word, Text )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *The question asks us to use th AFINN sentiment lexicon, and so we have to load it:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAFINN <- read.csv( \"data/AFINN Sentiment Lexicon.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *Instead of calculating the aggregate sentiment, we are asked to consider average sentiment per word. This means we cannot simply remove the words that are not in the sentiment lexicon, i.e, the anti_join() function would be a poor choice. Instead, we need to keep all the words and replace any NA entries by 0. This can, for instance, be achieved using the following code*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nReviews_Sentiment <- Reviews %>%\n  left_join( AFINN, by=\"word\" ) %>%\n  mutate( value = case_when( is.na(value)==TRUE ~ 0, .default = value ) ) %>%\n  group_by( Review ) %>%\n  summarise( Sentiment=mean(value) )\n```\n:::\n\n\nb) Plot the average sentiments calculated in part a) against the star ratings. What do you conclude?  \n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *To create the plot, we first need to link up the sentiment score derived in part a) with the star ratings:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nReviews_Sentiment <- Reviews_Sentiment %>% mutate( Score = Reviews_raw$Score )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *Now we can create box plots of the calculated sentiment scores for each category of the star rating:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot( Reviews_Sentiment, aes(x=Score, y=Sentiment) ) + \n  geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + labs( x=\"Star Rating\", y=\"Sentiment Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-5-Solution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We see that higher star ratings are associated with slightly higher sentiment scores. However, we should note that sentiment scores are quite variable, and thus the sentiment score is not necessarily a great predictor in terms of star rating.*</p>\n\n\n### **Homework Question - The work of H.G. Wells**\n\nWe want to analyze and compare the novels *The Time Machine* and *War of the Worlds* by the British author Herbert George Wells. The books are provided in the files \"Time Machine.csv\" and \"War of Worlds.csv\".\n\na) Compare the two books in terms of the words used within them.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We start by loading the two text data sets:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime_raw <- read.csv( \"data/Time Machine.csv\", fileEncoding = \"UTF-8\", as.is = TRUE )\nWar_raw <- read.csv( \"data/War of Worlds.csv\", fileEncoding = \"UTF-8\", as.is = TRUE )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *As in previous analyses, we split the texts into individual words and remove any underscores:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime <- Time_raw %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub( \"\\\\_\", \"\", word ) ) \nWar <- War_raw %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub( \"\\\\_\", \"\", word ) ) \n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *With the data ready for analysis, we calculate the number of occurrences and term frequency for each word before removing stop words:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime <- Time %>% \n  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>%\n  mutate( tf = n / sum(n) ) %>% \n  anti_join( stop_words, by=\"word\") \nWar <- War %>% \n  count( word, sort=TRUE ) %>%\n  mutate( tf = n / sum(n) ) %>% \n  anti_join( stop_words, by=\"word\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *To compare the two books, we merge the calculated term frequencies into one data frame and replace any missing entries (corresponding to the word only occurring in one book) with a value of 0:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime_War <- full_join( Time, War, by = \"word\" ) %>%\n  rename( tf.Time=tf.x, tf.War=tf.y ) %>%\n  mutate( tf.Time = case_when( is.na(tf.Time) == TRUE ~ 0, .default = tf.Time ),\n          tf.War = case_when( is.na(tf.War) == TRUE ~ 0, .default = tf.War ) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *As in Section 3.3.1, we plot the term frequencies for the different words against each other:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot( Time_War, aes( x=tf.Time, y=tf.War ) ) + geom_point() + \n  geom_abline( color=\"gray40\", linetype=2 ) +\n  geom_text( aes(label=word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust=1 ) + \n  coord_trans( x=\"sqrt\", y=\"sqrt\" ) + theme_bw() +\n  labs( x=\"Term Frequency in The Time Machine\",\n        y=\"Term Frequency in The War of the Worlds\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-5-Solution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *We see that the term frequency of the most common words is quite similar across the two books.

However, we have to be careful since the sentiment has been aggregated. For those of you familiar with the books, you may argue that these plots are not reflective of how the sentiment evolves and that it would be better to calculate sentiment for the individual chapters.*</p>\n\n\n#### Bonus\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Another option is to create bar plots which gives a sentiment score for every chapter of the book. Producing these plots is a bit challenging here since chapters do not start with the word \"chapter\". A close look at the text data, suggests that each chapter starts with string of the form \"I.\", \"II.\", .., that is, they are numbered using roman numerals. We can create these strings using *</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nChapterNumber <- as.roman(1:99)\nChapterNumber <- paste( ChapterNumber, \".\", sep=\"\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Having created these strings, we can now identify the lines which correspond to the start of a chapter and subsequently derive the chapter number for each line of text*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWar <- War_raw %>%\n  mutate( Chapter = case_when( text %in% ChapterNumber ~ 1, .default = 0) ) %>%\n  mutate( Chapter = cumsum(Chapter) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*In the same way wee find that in \"The Time Machine\" chapters start with \" I.\", \" II.\". So we follow a very similar strategy as for \"War of the Worlds\":*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nChapterNumber <- paste( \" \", ChapterNumber, sep=\"\" )\nTime <- Time_raw %>%\n  mutate( Chapter = case_when( text %in% ChapterNumber ~ 1, .default = 0) ) %>%\n  mutate( Chapter = cumsum(Chapter) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Now we can derive the sentiment scores for each of the two books using the same approach as in Section 3.2.2 of the lecture notes*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime_AFINN   <- Time %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub(\"_\", \"\", word ) ) %>%\n  inner_join( AFINN, by=\"word\" ) %>%\n  group_by( Chapter ) %>%\n  summarise( sentiment = sum( value ) )\n\nWar_AFINN   <- War %>%\n  unnest_tokens( word, text ) %>%\n  mutate( word = gsub(\"_\", \"\", word ) ) %>%\n  inner_join( AFINN, by=\"word\" ) %>%\n  group_by( Chapter ) %>%\n  summarise( sentiment = sum( value ) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Having derived the sentiment score for each book and chapter, we visualize the results:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTime_AFINN_plot <- ggplot( Time_AFINN, aes( x=Chapter, y=sentiment ) ) +\n  geom_col() + theme_bw() + \n  labs( x=\"Chapter\", y=\"AFINN sentiment score\", title = \"The Time Machine\" )\n\nWar_AFINN_plot <- ggplot( War_AFINN, aes( x=Chapter, y=sentiment ) ) +\n  geom_col() + theme_bw() + \n  labs( x=\"Chapter\", y=\"AFINN sentiment score\", title=\"War of the Worlds\" )\n\nTime_AFINN_plot + War_AFINN_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-5-Solution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
