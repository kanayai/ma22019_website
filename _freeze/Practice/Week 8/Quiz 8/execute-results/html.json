Exercises 1-2 help you with revising the content of the lecture in Week 8.\n\nYou may want to load the following packages before starting the exercise:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary( dplyr )\nlibrary( lubridate )\nlibrary( ggplot2 )\nlibrary( tidyr )\nlibrary( sf )\nlibrary( ggspatial )\nlibrary( prettymapr )\nlibrary( sp )\nlibrary( gstat )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen working on a University PC, you will have to first install some of these packages. \n\n\n\n### **Exercise 1 - Exploring spatial structure in river flow data**\n\nA data scientist used principal component analysis to explore the spatial structure / dependence in the daily maximum river flow values across 45 gauges in Northern England and the South of Scotland. They identified that the first 3 components explain more than 90% of the variation in the data and created the following plots representing the first three eigenvectors:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Quiz-8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nProvide an interpretation for the three plots and then go to Moodle and complete the quiz.\n\n\n### **Exercise 2 - Concentrations of zinc in the top soil**\n\nThe file \"Meuse.csv\" gives topsoil zinc concentrations (in mg/kg) collected across 155 locations in a flood plain of the river Meuse. Specifically, we are given\n\n* Lon,Lat - Longitude and latitude coordinate of the locations\n\n* Zinc - Zinc concentration on logarithmic scale\n\nPerform the following steps to explore the spatial structure in the data:\n\na) Visualize the zinc concentration on logarithmic scale using the ggspatial package. What do you conclude?\n\nb) Explore the spatial dependence in the zinc concentration on logarithmic scale by estimating the semi-variogram for the data. Go to Moodle and answer the quiz.\n\n",
