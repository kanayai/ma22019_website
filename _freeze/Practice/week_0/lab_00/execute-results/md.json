This is where you set the document's metadata: title, author, date, and output format. Think of it like the \"settings panel\" for your report. For more details, see the [Computing Setup Guide](https://kanayai.github.io/ma22019_website/computing_setup/setup.html).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Tips for Working in Quarto**\n>\n> - **Use Source Mode**: Click the \"Source\" button (top-left of this pane) to see the raw code. This helps you understand what's happening behind the scenes.\n> - **Render Often**: Hit the **Render** button every few minutes to catch errors early. Don't wait until you've written 100 lines!\n> - **File Naming**: Always use `snake_case` for file names (e.g., `my_analysis.qmd`, not `My Analysis.qmd`). See the [Golden Rules](#bonus-the-golden-rules-of-file-naming) at the end of this document.\n\n\n\n# 👋 Welcome to the Git Workflow!\n\nIf you are reading this in RStudio, **CONGRATULATIONS!** \nYou have successfully cloned your first repository. \nThat is 50% of the battle won.\n\nToday, we will finish the setup by learning how to **save** your work back to the cloud.\n\n---\n\n## Step 0: Verify Location (New!)\n \nBefore we start, let's make sure you are in the right place.\n \n1.  Look at the **Console** pane (bottom left).\n2.  Type `source(\"check_location.R\")` and press Enter.\n3.  If it says **SUCCESS**, you are good to go!\n4.  If it says **WARNING**, ask a TA for help immediately.\n \n---\n \n## Step 1: Tell Us Who You Are\n\nWe need to make sure your name appears correctly on your work.\n\n1.  Look at the top of this file (lines 1-5).\n2.  Find the line that says: `author: \"Your Name Here\"`.\n3.  Change `\"Your Name Here\"` to **your actual name** (e.g., `\"Jane Doe\"`).\n4.  Save this file (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S).\n\n### (Optional) Update your GitHub Profile\n\nSince we are setting things up, take a moment to look professional.\n\n1.  Click on your profile icon in the upper right corner of the [GitHub page](https://github.bath.ac.uk) and select **Settings**.\n2.  On the left side, click **Public profile**.\n3.  Fill out your information and **Add a profile picture** (it helps TAs learn your name!).\n4.  Click **Update profile**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Render to Markdown\n\nIn this course, we produce professional reports. Let's make one now.\n\n1.  Look for the **Render** button at the top of this pane (it has a blue right pointed arrow icon  icon here ).\n2.  Click **Render**.\n    *   *Note: If a popup asks you to install packages, say Yes.*\n3.  A beautiful Markdown file should appear (previewed in RStudio).\n\n> **Checkpoint**: Do you see your name in the title of the Markdown report?\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: The \"Save\" vs \"Commit\" Reality Check (CRITICAL)\n\nYou have just saved the file (Cmd+S) and Rendered it. \n\n**STOP AND THINK**: Where are these changes?\n\n*   ✅ They are on your **laptop's hard drive**.\n*   ❌ They are **NOT on GitHub** yet.\n\n### Prove it to yourself:\n\n1.  Open your web browser.\n2.  Go to your repository page on **github.bath.ac.uk** (refresh the page).\n3.  Look at `lab_00.qmd`.\n4.  Does it show your actual name? \n    *   **NO**, it still says `\"Your Name Here\"`.\n    *   This is because \"Saving\" only happens on your computer.\n\nTo get it to GitHub, we need the **Git Cycle**: **Stage -> Commit -> Push**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: The Build-up (Stage & Commit)\n\nThink of this like online shopping.\n\n1.  **Stage (The Shopping Basket)**\n\n    *   Go to the **Git Pane** (top right in RStudio).\n    *   Tick the **Staged** box next to `lab_00.qmd`.\n    *   *Meaning: \"I want to include this file in my next package.\"*\n\n2.  **Commit (The Order Confirmation)**\n    *   Click the **Commit** button.\n    *   Type a message: `\"Fixed author name\"`.\n    *   Click **Commit**.\n    *   *Meaning: \"I have sealed the package.\"*\n\n**PAUSE**: Even now, check GitHub again. **It is still not there!** \nA \"Commit\" is still only on your laptop (it's a saved version in your local Git history).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: The Release (Push)\n\nThis is the only step that moves data to the cloud.\n\n1.  **Push (The Delivery)**\n    *   Click the **Green Up Arrow** ⬆️ (Push) in the Git pane.\n    *   Wait for the message `HEAD -> main`.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Final Verification\n\n1.  Go back to your web browser.\n2.  **Refresh** the GitHub page.\n3.  Look at `lab_00.qmd`.\n4.  **NOW** it should show your actual name.\n5.  Look for `lab_00.md`. It should be there too! (And if you click it, it looks great!)\n\n✅ **Mission Accomplished**: You now understand the difference between *Saving* (Local) and *Pushing* (Cloud).\n\n---\n\n## One Last Thing: Prove R Works\n\nRun this code chunk just to see a cool plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    labs(\n        title = \"My First R Plot\",\n        subtitle = \"If you can see this, R is working perfectly.\",\n        x = \"Engine Size\",\n        y = \"Highway MPG\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab_00_files/figure-commonmark/test-plot-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Bonus: The Golden Rules of File Naming\n\nAs a Data Scientist, you will generate hundreds of files. If you name them poorly, you will lose them.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **The 3 Principles**\n>\n> 1.  **Machine Readable:** No spaces, punctuation, or accents. Use `_` or `-`.\n> 2.  **Human Readable:** Meaningful names. `analysis.R` is bad; `01_data_cleaning.R` is good.\n> 3.  **Sortable:** Use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and numbered prefixes (`01_`, `02_`).\n\n### Examples\n\n| Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |\n|--------|---------|\n| `my abstract.docx` | `2025-02-15_abstract.docx` |\n| `Joe's File.xlsx` | `joes_file.csv` |\n| `figure 1.png` | `fig01_scatterplot.png` |\n| `final_final_v2.R` | `04_model_evaluation.R` |\n\n**Apply these rules to every file you create from now on!**\n",
