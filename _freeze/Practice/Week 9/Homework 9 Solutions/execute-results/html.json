A wildlife conservation charity has collected data on reported sightings of grey squirrels for 2020-2022. The data they provided includes the following:\n\n**GreySquirrels.csv:** Sightings of grey squirrels reported to the wildlife conservation charity for 2020-2022:\n\n* Year: Year the sighting happened\n\n* Lon: Longitude coordinate of the sighting\n\n* Lat: Latitude coordinate of the sighting\n\n* Admin: Name of the administrative area, where the grey squirrel was sighted\n\n**UK Shapefile:** Folder containing shapefiles for the UK\n\n* UK.shp: Shapefile without administrative boundaries\n\n* UK admin.shp: Shapefile with boundaries for the administrative areas named in the file \"GreySquirrels.csv\"\n\nThe charity assured us that the data is representative of the spatial distribution of squirrels across Great Britain for all years. They ask you to use the data to investigate the following aspects:\n\na) What can we say about the spatial distribution of grey squirrels across Great Britain in 2022?\n\nb) Are there any areas of Great Britain that saw a notable change in the number of grey squirrels when we compare the data for 2020 and 2022?\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We start by loading the data and the shapefiles*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUK <- read_sf( \"Data/Shapefiles/UK_Shapefile/UK.shp\" )\nUK_county <- read_sf( \"Data/Shapefiles/UK_Shapefile/UK_admin.shp\" )\nSquirrels <- read.csv( \"data/GreySquirrels.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*To explore the spatial distribution of the grey squirrel for 2022, we extract the relevant observations*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSquirrels2022 <- filter( Squirrels, Year == 2022 )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Since we are working with point pattern data, we use techniques for analyzing point pattern data and create a ppp object*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUK <- st_reverse( UK )\nSquirrels2022_ppp <- ppp( Squirrels2022$Lon, Squirrels2022$Lat, poly = UK$geometry[[1]][[1]] )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: 11 points were rejected as lying outside the specified window\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">**Note:** *Some of the points are lying outside the area, because we only took the largest polygon. The omission of these few points will not affect our results due to there being about 10,800 observations in the data.*</p>\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We can now use the smoothed kernel intensity function to explore the spatial distribution*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlambdaC <- density.ppp( Squirrels2022_ppp, edge=TRUE, sigma=0.1 )\nplot( lambdaC, main=\"Grey Squirrels across Great Britain\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-9-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*The plot suggests that the highest density of grey squirrels can be found in the East Midlands, with a high intensity observed throughout England (except for Cornwall and Devon). On the other hand, we hardly observe any squirrels in West Wales and Scotland.*</p>\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*To measure the change in numbers, one option is to focus on the administrative areas and calculate the number of grey squirrels for 2020 and 2022 for each of them*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSquirrels_county <- Squirrels %>% \n  count( Year, County ) %>%\n  filter( Year %in% c(2020,2022) ) %>%\n  rename( Count = n ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Let's visualize the counts within each administrative boundary*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSquirrels2022 <- filter( Squirrels_county, Year == 2022 )\nUK_county <- full_join( UK_county, Squirrels2022, by=c(\"NAME_2\"=\"County\") )\n\nggplot( UK_county, aes(fill=Count) ) + \n  annotation_map_tile(zoom=5) + \n  theme_bw() + geom_sf() + \n  scale_fill_distiller( palette=\"Reds\", trans=\"reverse\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-9-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We see that North Yorkshire had the highest count in 2022, although it was not the area with the highest intensity - these differences are due to the different areas sizes.*</p>\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*The next step is to calculate the raw change in numbers for each administrative boundary*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSquirrels_county <- Squirrels_county %>%\n  pivot_wider( names_from = Year, values_from = Count ) %>%\n  mutate( `2020` = replace_na(`2020`,0), `2022` = replace_na(`2022`,0)  ) %>%\n  mutate( Change = `2022` - `2020` )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Finally, we visualize the calculated numbers:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUK_county <- UK_county %>% full_join( Squirrels_county, by=c(\"NAME_2\"=\"County\") )\nggplot( UK_county, aes(fill=Change) ) +  \n  annotation_map_tile(zoom=5) + \n  geom_sf() + theme_bw() +  \n  scale_fill_distiller( palette=\"Reds\", trans=\"reverse\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Homework-9-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We find that the areas that had the largest change in raw numbers are all located in northern England, in particular Cumbria saw a big increase in the number of grey squirrels.*</p>",
