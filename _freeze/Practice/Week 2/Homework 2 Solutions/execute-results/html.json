For each employee, we are given the following information\n\n* **work_year** - Year the data were collected for the employee\n\n* **experience_level** - Experience Level: Entry-level (EN), Junior (MI), Senior (SE) or Expert (EX)\n\n* **employment_type** - Full-time (FT), Part-time (PT) or Contingent Workers (CT)\n\n* **salary, salary_currency** - Nominal salary and currency in which it was paid\n\n* **salary_in_usd** - Nominal salary in U.S. Dollars\n\n* **employee_residence** - Country the employee is residing\n\n* **remote_ratio** - Proportion of time the employee may work from home\n\n* **company_location** - Location of the company's headquarters\n\n* **company_size** - Size of the company: Small (S), Medium (M) or Large (L)\n\nAn undergraduate is considering to take units in Data Science / Machine Learning / AI. However, they are unsure about the working conditions they are likely to experience if they decide to work in the sector. Specifically, the student plans to work full-time for an U.S. company, and they want to get some insight into the differences between small-/medium-sized and large companies. After a discussion with the student, the following three aspects have been identified as important for them: \n\na) Opportunity to work remotely for at least 50% of the time.\n\nb) Salaries for Entry-Level positions.\n\nc) Structure of the workforce in terms of experience level.\n\nPerform an analysis which considers the three aspects above. Make sure to clearly describe your approach and conclusions.\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We start by loading the data:*</p>\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary <- read.csv( \"data/Salary Data Scientists.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Since the student wants to work full-time for a US company, we have to remove any observations that don't refer to a US company and full-time employment:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary_USA <- Salary %>% \n  filter(  company_location==\"US\", employment_type==\"FT\" ) %>% \n  select( work_year, experience_level, salary_in_usd, remote_ratio, company_size )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*The final step is to convert the information on company size into a binary variable, because we want to compare large companies against the rest:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary_USA <- Salary_USA %>%\n  mutate( size = case_when( company_size==\"L\" ~ \"L\", .default = \"S/M\" )  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We are now ready to address the three aspects. Let's start with the ratio of employees that work remotely *</p>\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary_USA %>% \n  group_by( size ) %>% \n  summarise( \"Remote Working\" = round( mean( remote_ratio>=50 ), 3 ) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  size  `Remote Working`\n  <chr>            <dbl>\n1 L                0.816\n2 S/M              0.798\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We find that there are only small differences in the proportion of people that work remotely when comparing companies of different size.*</p>\n  \n<p style=\"color:blue\">*For the second part we derive some summaries for the salary in U.S. Dollars:*</p>\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary_USA %>% \n  filter( experience_level==\"EN\" ) %>%\n  group_by( size ) %>% \n  summarise( \"Median Salary\" = quantile( salary_in_usd, 0.5 ), \n             \"Average Salary\" = mean( salary_in_usd ),\n             \"Standard Deviation\" = sd( salary_in_usd ) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  size  `Median Salary` `Average Salary` `Standard Deviation`\n  <chr>           <dbl>            <dbl>                <dbl>\n1 L               85500          113850                67735.\n2 S/M             90000           90222.               25563.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We see that the medium salary for small-/medium-sized companies is larger than for large companies, and that the reverse is true for the average salary. Looking at the standard deviation we see that there is quite a bit of variation in the salary for entry-level positions.*</p>\n  \n  \n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Finally, we extract the number of employees at the different experience levels for the different company sizes:*</p>\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSalary_USA %>% \n  group_by( size, experience_level ) %>%\n  summarise( Number=n() ) %>%\n  mutate( Proportion = Number / sum(Number) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'size'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n# Groups:   size [2]\n  size  experience_level Number Proportion\n  <chr> <chr>             <int>      <dbl>\n1 L     EN                   10     0.0971\n2 L     EX                    5     0.0485\n3 L     MI                   41     0.398 \n4 L     SE                   47     0.456 \n5 S/M   EN                   18     0.0741\n6 S/M   EX                   10     0.0412\n7 S/M   MI                   46     0.189 \n8 S/M   SE                  169     0.695 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Looking at the numbers, the main difference between small/medium-sized and larger companies seems to lie in the proportion of junior/senior staff. For small/medium-sized companies about 2/3 of employees in the sector are at senior level, while it is less than 1/2 for larger companies.*</p>\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">**Here is were you should provide a conclusion which addressess the question!**</p>",
