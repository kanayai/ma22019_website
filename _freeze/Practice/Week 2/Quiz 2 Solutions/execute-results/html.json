We can then use the summarize() function to calculate summaries for the individual groups. Consequently, this function may be used to address the third issue.*</p>\n\ne) **rename()**\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *When we want to change variable names, the function rename() is the easiest option. So this function is useful to deal with uninformative variable names, i.e., the first issue.*</p>\n\nf) **slice_head()**\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\"> *The function slice_head() returns the first few elements of the data frame. We have to specify how many elements we want to print using the option* $\\mathrm{\\texttt{n=..}}$*. For instance,* $\\mathrm{\\texttt{n=5}}$ *prints the first five lines. As such, this function is useful if we are just interested in exploring the first few lines of a data frame, i.e. it may address the first issue.*</p>\n\nIf you are unsure about a function, you can use the **help()** function in R, or look at the cheat sheets provided on Moodle.\n\n### **Exercise 2 - Flights from New York City airports**\n\nThe file \"NYCFlights.csv\" provides data for flights in 2013 that departed from any of the three main airports servicing New York City: John F Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark (EWR). To load the data into your R Workspace, you can use\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNYCFlights <- read.csv( \"data/NYCFlights.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer the following questions using the provided data and submit your answers via the Moodle quiz:\n\na)  How many flights does the data set contain?\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We can use the function glimpse() to extract the number of observations*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse( NYCFlights )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 336,776\nColumns: 7\n$ month     <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ~\n$ dep_delay <int> 2, 4, 2, -1, -6, -4, -5, -3, -3, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -1, 0, ~\n$ arr_delay <int> 11, 20, 33, -18, -25, 12, 19, -14, -8, 8, -2, -3, 7, -14, 31~\n$ flight    <int> 1545, 1714, 1141, 725, 461, 1696, 507, 5708, 79, 301, 49, 71~\n$ tailnum   <chr> \"N14228\", \"N24211\", \"N619AA\", \"N804JB\", \"N668DN\", \"N39463\", ~\n$ origin    <chr> \"EWR\", \"LGA\", \"JFK\", \"JFK\", \"LGA\", \"EWR\", \"EWR\", \"LGA\", \"JFK~\n$ dest      <chr> \"IAH\", \"IAH\", \"MIA\", \"BQN\", \"ATL\", \"ORD\", \"FLL\", \"IAD\", \"MCO~\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*The output shows that the data set contains 336,776 flights.*</p>\n\n\nb) For which month were the most flights recorded?\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We use group_by() and summarize() to extract this information*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNYCFlights %>%\n  group_by( month ) %>%\n  summarize( Number_of_Flights = n() )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 12 x 2\n   month Number_of_Flights\n   <int>             <int>\n 1     1             27004\n 2     2             24951\n 3     3             28834\n 4     4             28330\n 5     5             28796\n 6     6             28243\n 7     7             29425\n 8     8             29327\n 9     9             27574\n10    10             28889\n11    11             27268\n12    12             28135\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*Looking at the table, we conclude that the most flights (29,425) were recorded for July.*</p>\n\n\nc)  Which plane (specified by the **tailnum** variable) departed most often from New York City airports in 2013?\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We again use group_by() and summarise(), but now also order the planes according to their number flights, since the data contain information for a large number of planes:*</p>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNYCFlights %>%\n  group_by( tailnum ) %>%\n  summarize( Number_of_Flights=n() ) %>%\n  arrange( desc(Number_of_Flights) ) %>%\n  slice_head( n=5 )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 2\n  tailnum Number_of_Flights\n  <chr>               <int>\n1 <NA>                 2512\n2 N725MQ                575\n3 N722MQ                513\n4 N723MQ                507\n5 N711MQ                486\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">*We have to ignore the first entry, because $\\mathrm{\\texttt{NA}}$ does not refer to a single plane, but to the data entries for which the tail number is not recorded.
