For each employee, we are given the following information\n\n* **work_year** - Year the data were collected for the employee\n\n* **experience_level** - Experience Level: Entry-level (EN), Junior (MI), Senior (SE) or Expert (EX)\n\n* **employment_type** - Full-time (FT), Part-time (PT) or Contingent Workers (CT)\n\n* **salary, salary_currency** - Nominal salary and currency in which it was paid\n\n* **salary_in_usd** - Nominal salary in U.S. Dollars\n\n* **employee_residence** - Country the employee is residing\n\n* **remote_ratio** - Proportion of time the employee may work from home\n\n* **company_location** - Location of the company's headquarters\n\n* **company_size** - Size of the company: Small (S), Medium (M) or Large (L)\n\nAn undergraduate is considering to take units in Data Science / Machine Learning / AI. However, they are unsure about the working conditions they are likely to experience if they decide to work in the sector. Specifically, the student plans to work full-time for an U.S. company, and they want to get some insight into the differences between small-/medium-sized and large companies. After a discussion with the student, the following three aspects have been identified as important for them: \n\na) Opportunity to work remotely for at least 50% of the time.\n\nb) Salaries for Entry-Level positions.\n\nc) Structure of the workforce in terms of experience level.\n\nPerform an analysis which considers the three aspects above. Make sure to clearly describe your approach and conclusions.\n",
