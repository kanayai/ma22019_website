Please check your timetable for time and location. No tutorial in Week 5!\n\n**Getting Help:**\n\n-   Use the Padlet board or send me an email\n\n-   **Office Hour:** Monday 9:00-11:00 (in-person)\n\n\n## What can you find on Moodle?\n\n-   Lecture notes in HTML and PDF format\n\n-   Data sets and R files to reproduce the results in the lecture notes\n\n-   Material for the problem class\n\n-   Problem sheets and solutions\n\n-   Slides from the lecture\n\n-   Cheat sheets for some of the R packages we will be using\n\n-   Coursework\n\n\n## Problem Sheets and Coursework\n\nProblem sheets provide\n\n-   Exercises for revision. Check answers on Moodle.\n\n-   Tutorial questions: More advanced than exercises.\n\n-   Homework question: Similar to coursework questions.\n\n\nYour mark will be determined by two pieces of coursework:\n\n-   CW1 (40%): Set 15:00 on 21 Feb, due 17:00 on 28 Feb.\n\n-   CW2 (60%): Set at the start of Week 10, due in Week 11.\n\n**You will receive individual feedback and provisional marks for CW1 before the release of CW2.**\n\n\n## Changes made based on OUE feedback\n\n1. Additional problem classes in Weeks 1-3\n\n2. More guidance on how coursework will be marked.\n\nEach coursework question will be assessed as a whole based on:\n\n  + Correctness\n    \n  + Quality\n    \n  + Presentation and conciseness\n\nTo reflect this, your answer to the homework question will be marked as (i) <50%, (ii) 50-69% or (iii) >=70%.\n\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose we had ambulance response data which includes:\n\n- Waiting time of the patient\n\n- Ambulance response category (1='life-threatening', 4='non-urgent')\n\n- Time patient spent in hospital\n\nYou are asked to consider the question:\n\n*\"Does the data suggest that the length of stay in hospital increases with the time until the ambulance arrives?\"*\n\nI will present three answers, and you have to decide a mark.\n\n## Any questions? \n\n**Let's have a 5-minute break.**\n",
