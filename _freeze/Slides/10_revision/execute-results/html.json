Coursework 2 will be released on Friday 25 April at 9:00am, and the deadline is Tuesday 6 May at 12:00pm (noon).\n\n2. This is our final lecture - there will be a 10:00-12:30 office hour instead of a lecture next week. \n\n3. Tutorials in Week 11 will be there for you to work on the coursework and to ask questions.\n\n4. Questions can be posted to the Padlet board - please don't expect answers to questions posted after 17:00 on Friday 2 May.\n\n5. No 9:00-11:00 office hour on Monday 28 April.\n\n## Plan for Today\n\nThe most requested topics (based on 3 responses) were\n\n- Topic modelling / LDA\n\n- Semi-variogram\n\nWe will spend about 20 minutes on each of the two topics.\n\n\n# Topic Modelling / LDA\n\n## Setup \n\n\nWe have $N$ documents and $M$ unique words.\n\nOur aim is to structure the text data into $K$ topics with:\n\n* Each document can feature multiple topics (with varying proportions)\n\n* Each word can feature in multiple topics (with varying proportions)\n\n\n\nWe introduced LDA to estimate: \n\n1. The topics;\n\n2. The proportions with which topics feature in each document.\n\n\n## LDA as a generative model \n\nLet's consider from a different angle.\n\n<span style='color: blue;'>Generation of new documents:</span>\n\n**STEP 1:** Sample the proportion with which each topic features.\n\n**STEP 2:** Sample the words.\n\n## What to remember\n\n- Topic modelling can be a powerful tool to analyse, structure and classify documents. \n\n- The topics produced by LDA may not be what we expect </br> <span style='color: blue;'>-> hard to interpret our findings</span>\n\n- Stop words should be removed\n\nLet's have a look at the example in Section 3.4.4, which we did not consider in Week 6.\n\n\n# Semi-variogram\n\n## Definition and Assumption 1 \n\n\nWe explore the dependence between sites $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}$ using the semi-variogram\n\\[\n\\gamma(\\mathbf{s},\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[X(\\mathbf{s}) - X(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}})\\right]\n\\]\nunder the assumption that $X(\\mathbf{s})$ and $X(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}})$ have the same mean (**constant mean**).\n\n<span style='color: blue;'>How do we check the constant mean assumption?</span>\n\n\n\n-> We have to discuss the assumption in the context of the data and application.\n\n\n\n## Estimation and Assumption 2 \n\n\nWe assume that $\\gamma(\\mathbf{s},\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}})$ is fully defined by the distance between $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}$.\n\n<span style='color: blue;'>How do we check this assumption?</span>\n\n\n\n-> Differences in levels should be similar for all areas and directions.\n\n\n\n\nSo we can define a function $\\tilde{\\gamma}:\\mathbb{R}_+\\to\\mathbb{R}_+$ with\n\\[\n\\gamma(\\mathbf{s} , \\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(||\\mathbf{s}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}||),\n\\]\n\nThe function $\\tilde{\\gamma}()$ is estimated from the data.\n\n\n## What to look out for?\n\n* Are the assumptions sensible? -> Visualize the data and, if possible, discuss the assumptions in context.\n\n* Does the estimate increase with distance? -> spatial dependence weakens with increasing distance\n\n* Is there a point at which the estimate is close to flat? -> Marks the distance at which outcomes are close to independent\n\n* Did we set suitable values for the **width** and **cutoff**? -> Check number of points per estimate. \n\nLet's look at one more example: air pollution across Manchester.\n\n",
