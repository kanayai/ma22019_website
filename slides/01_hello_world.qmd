## What is Data Science? 🤔 

> "Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge." — *R for Data Science*

. . .

It is **NOT** just about:

- ❌ Coding continuously
- ❌ Memorizing commands
- ❌ Complex logic or maths (yet)

. . .

It **IS** about:

- ✅ **Curiosity**
- ✅ **Communication**
- ✅ **Reproducibility**

## Why a Survey? 🤔

We need raw ingredients for our cooking show.

1.  **Real Data**: Not a boring pre-made dataset.
2.  **Messy Data**: Real humans make typos.
3.  **Instant Feedback**: From "Response" to "Insight" in 5 mins.

*Your answers are anonymous and will only be used for this demo.*

---

## 📊 Live Data Experiment!

We need some **DATA** to work with.

Please scan this code and answer 4 quick questions:

<center>
[MICROSOFT FORMS QR CODE HERE]

::: {.r-stack}
::: {}
1. Hours of sleep? 😴
2. Coding confidence (1-10)? 🤓
3. Favorite 'probability' word? 🎲
4. Used AI for code? 🤖

# The Magic Trick 🪄

Let's see what you just said...

*(Live Demo: RStudio)*

---

## The Raw Data 🙈

*(Screenshot of messy raw Excel/CSV)*

Usually, data looks like this:
- Weird column names
- Missing values
- Typos ("Bayseian", "baesian", "Bayes!")

---

## The Clean Data ✨

```r
library(tidyverse)

survey_data <- read_csv("responses.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(sleep = how_many_hours_did_you_sleep)
```

. . .

Now we can ask questions!

---

## Question 1: How tired are you? 😴

```r
ggplot(survey_data, aes(x = sleep)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Class Sleep Distribution")
```

*(Plot appears here)*

---

## Question 2: The "Word Cloud" ☁️

"What is your favorite probability word?"

```r
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)

survey_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, prob_word) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 50))
```

# Meet the Toolkit 🛠️

We use professional, industry-standard tools.

---

## 1. R (The Engine) 🚗

- The programming language.
- It does the calculations.
- Like the **engine** of a car.

![](../img/r-logo.png){width="150px"}

---

## 2. RStudio (The Dashboard) 🏎️

- The interface where you work.
- It has the steering wheel, speedometer, GPS.
- You drive the car (R) *through* the dashboard (RStudio).

![](../img/rstudio-logo.png){width="200px"}

---

## 3. Quarto (The Lab Notebook) 📓

- Where you write your code AND your report.
- Combines text, code, and plots.
- "Literate Programming" — code that humans can read.

![](../img/quarto-logo.png){width="150px"}

---

## 4. Git & GitHub (The Time Machine) ⏳

**Git** = "Save Points" in a video game.
- Did you break your code?
- Go back to yesterday's save point!

**GitHub** = The Cloud.
- Where you submit your work.
- Where you get course materials.

---

# Housekeeping 🧹

---

## The Schedule 🗓️

**Weeks 1-5**: 
- Lecture (Wed) + Lab (Mon/Tue).
- **Weeks 1-3:** "Live Coding" on Fridays.

**Weeks 6 & 11**:
- **Coursework Deadlines** 🚨

---

## Assessment 📝

1.  **Formative (Practice)**
    - Weekly Labs
    - Weekly Homeworks
    - *Marked by Tutors for feedback, not grade.*

2.  **Summative (The Real Deal)**
    - **Coursework 1 (40%)**: Due Week 6
    - **Coursework 2 (60%)**: Due Week 11

---

## "Flipped Classroom" 🙃

We follow the **R for Data Science (2e)** approach.

1.  **Read** the assigned chapter from [r4ds.hadley.nz](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) BEFORE the lecture.
2.  **Come** to the lecture for:
    - Live Demos & Applications
    - Interactive Quizzes (Mentimeter)
    - Discussion
    - "The big picture"

---

## Your First Mission 🚀

**Install Everything.**

Go to the **Computing Setup** page on Moodle/Website.

You need:
1. R & RStudio
2. Quarto
3. Git
4. A GitHub Account (University one!)

**Deadline**: Before your first Lab (Monday/Tuesday).
