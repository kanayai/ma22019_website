## Plan for Today {.larger}

-   Overview of the course

-   Data cleaning (Section 1.1)

-   Working with a single data frame (Section 1.2)

## Welcome to the World of Data Science!

```{r, echo=F, out.width='55%', fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
library(MASS, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
circle <- function( x, r ){
  z <- seq( 0, 2*pi, length.out = 1000 )
  return( cbind( x[1]+r*cos(z), x[2]+r*sin(z) ) )
}
par(mai=c(0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01))
plot( circle( x = c(0, -sqrt(2) ), r=2 ), xlab="", ylab="",
      xaxt="n", yaxt="n", type='l', xlim=c(-3.1,3.1), 
      ylim=c(-3.4,2.8) )
lines( circle( x = sqrt(2) * c(-cos(pi/6),sin(pi/6)), r=2 ) )
lines( circle( x = sqrt(2) * c(cos(pi/6),sin(pi/6)), r=2 ) )
text(label = c("Mathematics"), x=-2, y=1.1, cex=1.8)
text(label = c("Statistics"), x=-2, y=0.6, cex=1.8)
text(label = c("Computer Science"), x=0, y=-2, cex=1.8)
text(label = c("Application"), x=2, y=1, cex=1.8)
text(label = c("Data"), x=0, y=0.35, cex=2.0, col=2)
text(label = c("Science"), x=0, y=-0.05, cex=2.0, col=2)
```

## Outlook

At the end of the course, you will be able to produce and interpret graphics such as

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Teaser.png")
```

## R and RStudio

We will use R throughout this course. 

I recommend that you install R and RStudio on your own computer / laptop. 

You should run the commands in "InstallPackages.R" to ensure you have all the relevant R packages. 

Except for patchwork, the packages we use for Weeks 1-4 are already installed on the campus computers.


## Timetable

The number of hours varies a bit across weeks

- In-person lecture on Wednesday 10:15-12:05 (W 1-3, 5-9) / 10:15-11:05 (W 4,10,11)

- Online problem class (on Zoom) on Friday 14:15-15:05 (W 1-3)

**Tutorial:** Take place on Tuesday. Please check your timetable for time and location. No tutorial in Week 5!

**Getting Help:**

-   Use the Padlet board or send me an email

-   **Office Hour:** Monday 9:00-11:00 (in-person)


## What can you find on Moodle?

-   Lecture notes in HTML and PDF format

-   Data sets and R files to reproduce the results in the lecture notes

-   Material for the problem class

-   Problem sheets and solutions

-   Slides from the lecture

-   Cheat sheets for some of the R packages we will be using

-   Coursework


## Problem Sheets and Coursework

Problem sheets provide

-   Exercises for revision. Check answers on Moodle.

-   Tutorial questions: More advanced than exercises.

-   Homework question: Similar to coursework questions.


Your mark will be determined by two pieces of coursework:

-   CW1 (40%): Set 15:00 on 21 Feb, due 17:00 on 28 Feb.

-   CW2 (60%): Set at the start of Week 10, due in Week 11.

**You will receive individual feedback and provisional marks for CW1 before the release of CW2.**


## Changes made based on OUE feedback

1. Additional problem classes in Weeks 1-3

2. More guidance on how coursework will be marked.

Each coursework question will be assessed as a whole based on:

  + Correctness
    
  + Quality
    
  + Presentation and conciseness

To reflect this, your answer to the homework question will be marked as (i) <50%, (ii) 50-69% or (iii) >=70%.


## Example

Suppose we had ambulance response data which includes:

- Waiting time of the patient

- Ambulance response category (1='life-threatening', 4='non-urgent')

- Time patient spent in hospital

You are asked to consider the question:

*"Does the data suggest that the length of stay in hospital increases with the time until the ambulance arrives?"*

I will present three answers, and you have to decide a mark.

## Any questions? 

**Let's have a 5-minute break.**
