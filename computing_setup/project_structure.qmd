## For Students Not Using Git

This guide is for students who are following the [manual (non-Git) workflow](traditional_workflow.qmd). If you're using Git (recommended), see the [Computer Setup Guide](setup.qmd) instead.

## 1. Organizing Your Workspace

Whether you are using a university PC (H: Drive) or your own laptop, you need a dedicated home for this course.

**Where should you put it?**

- **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`
- **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/` (or `C:\MA22019\` if Documents is synced to OneDrive)
- **Mac/Linux:** `~/Documents/MA22019/` (or `~/MA22019/` if Documents is synced to iCloud)

### Recommended Folder Structure

We recommend the following structure to handle the **three types of activities** in this course:

```
MA22019/
├── materials/                # Course materials (labs, solutions, live coding)
│   ├── labs/
│   ├── lab_solutions/
│   └── live_coding/
│
├── homework/                 # Your personal homework repos (Formative)
│   ├── hw_01-yourusername/
│   └── hw_02-yourusername/
│
└── coursework/               # Your personal coursework repos (Summative)
    ├── cw_01-yourusername/
    └── cw_02-yourusername/
```

### The Three Activity Types

1. **Labs (Formative):** In-class exercises found in `materials/labs/`. Great for practice.
2. **Homework (Formative):** Weekly open-ended questions. Each homework is cloned to your `homework/` folder.
3. **Coursework (Summative):** The **two major assessed** pieces of work, cloned to your `coursework/` folder.

## 2. Inside a Project (The "Tidy" Project)

Every activity in this course — whether it's a **lab**, **lab solution**, **live coding session**, **homework**, or **coursework** — follows the same internal structure. This consistency means you'll always know where to find things:

```
my_activity/
├── my_activity.Rproj   # RStudio Project file (NEVER delete this)
├── my_activity.qmd     # Your main report/analysis
├── data/               # Data files for this activity
└── README.md           # (Optional) Explanation of what this does
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Same Structure Everywhere

Whether you're opening `lab_01/`, `hw_02-yourusername/`, or `cw_01-yourusername/`, you'll find this same layout. This is intentional — once you learn it, you can navigate any activity in the course!
:::

### Why this matters?

1.  **Relative Paths:** You can load data with `read.csv("data/raw/my_data.csv")`. This works on your computer, your friend's computer, and the marker's computer.
2.  **Clean Workspace:** `output/` keeps your generated files (which you can delete and regenerate) separate from your source code.
3.  **Sanity:** You know exactly where to find the raw data vs. the cleaned data.

## 3. File Naming Rules

When creating your own files, follow these rules:

| Rule | Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|------|--------|---------|
| No spaces | `my analysis.R` | `my_analysis.R` |
| No special characters | `Joe's file.R` | `joes_file.R` |
| Use dates (YYYY-MM-DD) | `final_v2.R` | `2026-02-15_analysis.R` |
| Number for order | `intro.R`, `cleaning.R` | `01_intro.R`, `02_cleaning.R` |

See Lab 0 for more detailed naming examples.
