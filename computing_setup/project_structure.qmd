## For Students Not Using Git

This guide is for students who are following the [manual (non-Git) workflow](traditional_workflow.qmd). If you're using Git (recommended), see the [Computer Setup Guide](setup.qmd) instead.

## 1. Organizing Your Workspace

Whether you are using a university PC (H: Drive) or your own laptop, you need a dedicated home for this course.

**Where should you put it?**

- **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`
- **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/` (or `C:\MA22019\` if Documents is synced to OneDrive)
- **Mac/Linux:** `~/Documents/MA22019/` (or `~/MA22019/` if Documents is synced to iCloud)

### Recommended Folder Structure

We recommend the following structure to handle the **three types of activities** in this course:

```
MA22019/
├── 01_Labs/                  # Weekly Computer Labs (Formative)
│   ├── Week_01_Lab/
│   ├── Week_02_Lab/
│   └── ...
│
├── 02_Homework/              # Weekly Homework Questions (Formative)
│   ├── Week_01_HW/
│   └── ...
│
├── 03_Coursework/            # Assessed Summative Work (Graded)
│   ├── CW_1_Wrangling/
│   └── CW_2_Project/
│
└── 04_Resources/             # Lecture notes, cheat sheets
    ├── ggplot2_cheatsheet.pdf
    └── ...
```

### The Three Activity Types

1.  **Labs (Formative):** These are the exercises we do together in the computer labs. Great for practice.
2.  **Homework (Formative):** Weekly open-ended questions. These help you verify your understanding.
3.  **Coursework (Summative):** These are the **two major assessed** pieces of work.

## 2. Inside a Project (The "Tidy" Project)

Every time you start a new RStudio Project (e.g., for a Lab or Coursework), use this internal structure:

```
my_project/
├── my_project.Rproj    # RStudio Project file (NEVER delete this)
├── README.md           # Explanation of what this project does
├── data/               # Raw and processed data
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── R/                  # R scripts (if you have complex functions)
├── output/             # Plots, tables, and saved results
└── analysis.qmd        # Your main report/analysis
```

### Why this matters?

1.  **Relative Paths:** You can load data with `read.csv("data/raw/my_data.csv")`. This works on your computer, your friend's computer, and the marker's computer.
2.  **Clean Workspace:** `output/` keeps your generated files (which you can delete and regenerate) separate from your source code.
3.  **Sanity:** You know exactly where to find the raw data vs. the cleaned data.

## 3. File Naming Rules

When creating your own files, follow these rules:

| Rule | Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|------|--------|---------|
| No spaces | `my analysis.R` | `my_analysis.R` |
| No special characters | `Joe's file.R` | `joes_file.R` |
| Use dates (YYYY-MM-DD) | `final_v2.R` | `2026-02-15_analysis.R` |
| Number for order | `intro.R`, `cleaning.R` | `01_intro.R`, `02_cleaning.R` |

See Lab 0 for more detailed naming examples.
