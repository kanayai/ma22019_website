## The Big Picture: How This Course Works

Unlike traditional courses where you download ZIP files from Moodle, we use **GitHub** to keep everything organized. Here's the flow:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    subgraph GitHub["GitHub (github.bath.ac.uk)"]
        A["Course Materials"]
        B["Your Homework Repo"]
        E["Your Coursework Repo"]
        G["Your Practice Repo"]
    end
    
    subgraph Computer["Your Computer"]
        C["materials/"]
        D["homework/hw-01/"]
        F["coursework/cw-01/"]
        H["practice/lab-00/"]
    end

    D -->|Push your work| B
    E -->|Clone once| F
    F -->|Push your work| E

    style F fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style G fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style H fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```




**Two simple concepts:**

| Action | When You Use It | What It Does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Pull** ⬇️ | Every week for labs & solutions | **Downloads** updates to a repo you already have |
| **Clone** 📋 | Once per homework/coursework | **Creates** a fresh copy of a new repo |

That's it! Master these two actions and you're set for the whole semester. 💪

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🏖️ The Practice Sandbox
The `practice/` folder isn't just for Lab 00! Use it as your personal **Sandbox** throughout the semester. if you want to test a function from a lecture or try out an idea, create a script inside `practice/` (e.g., `practice/experiment_week1.R`). It keeps your main `materials` and `homework` folders clean!

## Your Weekly Routine

### 📚 Before Each Lab 

Every week, new lab materials get added to the `materials` repository. Here's how to get them:

1. **Open the materials project** 
   - Navigate to your `MA22019/materials/` folder
   - Double-click `materials.Rproj` to open RStudio
   
2. **Pull the latest updates**
   - Look for the **Git** pane (top-right area)
   - Click the **Pull** button (blue down arrow ⬇️)
   
3. **Check for new content**
   - New labs appear in `labs/`
   - Solutions appear in `lab_solutions/` (after they're released)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Make Pulling a Habit!

Pull *every time* you open the materials project. It takes 2 seconds and ensures you always have the latest content. Think of it like refreshing your email — do it automatically!
:::

### 🧪 During the Lab

1. Navigate to `labs/lab_XX/`
2. Double-click `lab_XX.Rproj` to open that specific lab

::: {.callout-note}
## Switching Projects

When you open a new `.Rproj` file, RStudio will close your current project and open the new one. This is normal! Each project is like opening a different Word document.
:::

3. Work through the exercises
4. **Save frequently** (Ctrl/Cmd + S) — there's no auto-save!
   - (Remember to follow the [File Naming Rules](#best-practices-file-naming-rules)!)

Labs are for practice, so you don't submit them. Your work stays on your computer.

### ✅ After the Lab (Getting Solutions)

Want to check your answers? Solutions are released sometime after each lab:

1. Open the `materials` project (double-click `materials.Rproj`)
2. Click **Pull**
3. Check `lab_solutions/` — your answers are waiting!

---

## Live Coding Sessions (Weeks 1–3)

Friday sessions in Weeks 1, 2, and 3 are **Live Coding** — you'll code along with the lecturer in real-time. 

**Before each session:**

1. Open your `materials` project
2. Click **Pull** to get the latest files
3. Navigate to `live_coding/week_XX/`
4. Open the provided script and follow along!

These are great practice for seeing how experienced coders think and work. Don't worry about keeping up perfectly — focus on understanding the approach.

---

## Homework Workflow

Homeworks are **formative** (for learning, not your final grade). You'll get feedback from your Tutor to help you improve. Here's the full process:

### Step 1: Clone Your Personal Homework Repo

Each homework has a unique URL just for you. 

1. **Find your URL on Moodle** 
   - It looks like: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/hw-01-yourusername.git`
   
2. **Clone in RStudio**
   - Go to **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
   - Paste your URL
   - Leave 'Project directory name' blank
   - **Important!** Click **Browse** and navigate to `MA22019/homework/`
   - Check the box 'Open in new session'
   - Click **Create Project**

![How cloning works](../img/git_clone_flow.png)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Clone to the Right Folder!

Always clone homework into `MA22019/homework/` and each coursework into `MA22019/coursework/`. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to find your work later.
:::

> **Note**: For a refresh on file paths and creating folders, see the [Setup Guide](setup.qmd#create-your-folder-structure) or check the [Quick Reference](#quick-reference-card).

### Step 2: Do the Work

1. Open the `.qmd` file provided
2. Work through the questions
3. Click **Render** regularly to preview your work as Markdown
4. **Save frequently!** (Ctrl/Cmd + S)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Previewing Your Work

Every time you click **Render**, a Markdown (.md) file is created on your computer. RStudio automatically opens the preview so you can see exactly how your finished report looks. This is how you check your work before submitting!

The .md file stays on your computer — it won't be explicitly uploaded to GitHub (unless you push). You only submit your **source files** (`.qmd`, `.R`), and your Tutor or Lecturer will render them to check your output.
:::

### Step 3: Commit Your Progress

Think of commits as "save points" in a video game. You want several of these!

1. Go to the **Git** pane (top-right)
2. Check the boxes next to files you changed (this is called "staging")
3. Click **Commit**
4. Write a brief message describing what you did (e.g., "Completed Q1 and Q2")
5. Click **Commit** again

::: {.callout-tip}
## Commit Early, Commit Often!

Aim for **at least 3 commits** per homework. This shows your progress and protects your work. If something breaks, you can always go back to a previous commit!
:::

### Step 4: Push Your Work (Submit!)

1. Click the **Push** button (green up arrow ⬆️)
2. Enter your Bath username and password if prompted
3. Done! Your work is now safely on GitHub 🎉

::: {.callout-note}
## What Gets Submitted?

When you push, **everything** in your folder is uploaded. You may submit your work in one of three formats:

1.  **Quarto Document (`.qmd`)**: The gold standard. Submitting the source `.qmd` and the rendered `.md` is best practice.
2.  **R Script (`.R`)**: Good for pure code or scripts without narrative.
3.  **Markdown File (`.md`)**: Useful if you prefer writing in plain Markdown.

**Why submit the `.md` file?**
The `.md` file (the "Cake") lets Tutors instantly see your plotted graphs and tables on GitHub without running code. The source file (the "Recipe") allows them to reproduce your analysis.
:::


Once pushed, your **Tutor** can see your code and provide feedback directly on your repository (via the **Issues** tab). This is the primary way we help you improve!

### Step 5: Verify Your Submission

Trust but verify! Make sure your work actually uploaded:

1. Go to `github.bath.ac.uk` in your browser
2. Find your homework repository
3. Check that:
   - Your `.qmd`, `.md`, and other files are there
   - The commit time is *before* the deadline

## Coursework Workflow

Coursework is **summative** — it counts toward your final mark! The process is exactly the same as homework, but with one key difference: **clone into the `coursework/` folder instead**.

::: {.callout-important}
## Coursework Submission Reminder

Just like homework, you submit your **source files** (`.qmd`, `.R`, etc.) **as well as** the rendered Markdown (`.md`). The Lecturer will render your work for marking, but the `.md` file helps us check your plots and tables quickly on GitHub.

**Always click Render** before your final push to make sure your code actually runs without errors!
:::

### Data Submission Policy 💾

We have over 180 repositories to manage, so we need to be careful with storage size.

*   **Small Data (< 10MB)**: It is totally fine to include small datasets (CSV, Excel) in your repository and commit them.
*   **Large Data (> 10MB)**: Please **do not commit** large datasets. Instead:
    *   Load the data directly from a URL (e.g., `read_csv("https://...")`).
    *   Or, use an R package that contains the data (e.g., `library(palmerpenguins)`).

If you are unsure if your data is "too big," ask on the discussion forum!

### Your Folder Structure

```
MA22019/
├── materials/
├── practice/          ← Practice labs (like Lab 00)
├── homework/
│   ├── hw-01-yourusername/
│   └── hw-02-yourusername/
└── coursework/
    ├── cw-01-yourusername/   ← Coursework goes here!
    └── cw-02-yourusername/
```

### The 3-Commit Rule 📜

For coursework, we require **at least 3 commits** showing your progress. This isn't just bureaucracy — it serves important purposes:

| Why We Require It | How It Helps You |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Verifies authenticity | Shows it's genuinely your work |
| Enables partial credit | If something breaks, we can see what you did right |
| Creates checkpoints | You can roll back if you mess something up |

**Good commit messages look like:**

| Commit | Message |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | "Started data cleaning and exploration" |
| 2 | "Completed analysis section with visualizations" |
| 3 | "Finished write-up and rendered final Markdown" |

---

---

## Best Practices: File Naming Rules 🏷️

Good file naming is a superpower. Follow these rules for all your files:

| Rule | Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|------|--------|---------|
| No spaces | `my analysis.qmd` | `my_analysis.qmd` (or `.R`, `.md`) |
| No special characters | `Joe's file.qmd` | `joes_file.qmd` |
| Use dates (YYYY-MM-DD) | `final_v2.md` | `2026-02-15_analysis.md` |
| Number to preserve order | `intro.R`, `cleaning.R` | `01_intro.R`, `02_cleaning.R` |

---

## Data Management in Repositories 💾

Repositories are for code, not massive datasets. Follow these rules to keep your repo healthy:

### 1. Small Data is Okay ( < 10MB )
If you have a *source* dataset (e.g., a CSV or Excel file) that is **smaller than 10MB**, it is generally fine to commit it to your repository. This ensures your code is reproducible because the data is right there.

### 2. Large Data is NOT Okay
Do **not** commit large datasets (> 10MB) or intermediate data files that your code generates.
*   **Why?** GitHub has strict size limits, and large files make cloning slow for everyone.
*   **What to do:** Keep large observations on your local machine and read them into your script.

> **Note:** We will provide specific instructions on using `.gitignore` to automatically exclude these files when the Coursework is released.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

**Q: I forgot to pull before lab. Am I in trouble?**

Nope! Just pull now — you'll get everything immediately. No harm done.

**Q: I can't find my homework/coursework repo URL.**

Check the MA22019 Moodle page for the URL. On Rstudio make sure you're logged into `github.bath.ac.uk` (not `github.com`).

**Q: I cloned to the wrong folder. Help!**

Easy fix: delete the incorrectly-placed folder and clone again to the right location.

**Q: How do I know my work was actually submitted?**

Visit `github.bath.ac.uk`, find your repo, and check that your latest files and commit time are visible. If you can see it there, we can see it too!

**Q: RStudio is asking for my password every time I push.**

That's normal on university computers. Just enter your Bath credentials each time.

**Important**: If you have enabled **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** on your GitHub account, your regular password will NOT work. You must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead. See the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.qmd#if-you-enabled-two-factor-authentication-2fa) for instructions.

**Q: I tried to push and got a "403 Forbidden" error.**

Don't panic! This usually happens if you try to push changes to the **course materials** repository.
*   **Why:** The `materials` repo is read-only for students (so you don't accidentally delete the lecture notes!).
*   **Fix:** You cannot push to `materials`. You should only **Pull** from it. If you want to save your own experiments, do them in your `practice/` folder instead.

On your personal laptop, you can set up credential caching to avoid this.
