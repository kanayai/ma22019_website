title: "Weekly Workflow"
---

> **Goal**: Know exactly what to do each week — when to pull, when to clone, what to submit.

## Why Use GitHub? (vs. "The Moodle Way")

In a traditional course, you might download zip files from Moodle, unzip them, work on them, zip them back up, and re-upload. This creates a mess of versions (`final_v2_REAL.zip`) and makes it hard to get help.

In this course, we use **GitHub** to keep everything organized and synced. See [Why Learn Git?](why_teach_github.md) for the full story.

## The Two Actions You'll Use

![Git workflow: Clone for first download, Pull to get updates, Push to upload your work](../img/git_workflow.png)

| Action | When | What It Does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Pull** | Every week for labs/solutions | Downloads updates to an existing repo |
| **Clone** | Once per homework/coursework | Creates a new copy of a repo on your computer |

---

## Weekly Lab Workflow

### Before Each Lab/Live Coding Session

1. Open the `materials` project in RStudio (double-click `materials.Rproj`)
2. Click **Pull** in the Git pane (blue down arrow)
3. New labs appear in `materials/labs/`

### During Lab

1. Navigate to `materials/labs/lab_XX/`
2. Double-click `lab_XX.Rproj` to open the lab project
3. Work through the exercises
4. **Save** your work (Ctrl/Cmd + S)

::: {.callout-note}
Labs are practice — you don't submit them. Your work is saved locally.
:::

### After Lab (Getting Solutions)

1. Open the `materials` project
2. Click **Pull**
3. Solutions appear in `materials/lab_solutions/`

---

## Live Coding Workflow (Weeks 1–3)

On Fridays in Weeks 1, 2, and 3, we have **Live Coding** sessions.

1. Open `materials` project
2. Click **Pull**
3. Navigate to `materials/live_coding/week_XX/`
4. Use the provided script to code along with the lecturer

---

## Homework Workflow

Homework is **formative** (practice with TA feedback). You clone a personal copy and push your work.

### Step 1: Clone Your Homework Repo

1. Find your homework URL on Moodle (looks like `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/hw_01-yourusername.git`)
2. In RStudio: **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
3. Paste the URL
4. **Important**: Click **Browse** and navigate to `MA22019/homework/`
5. Click **Create Project**

### Step 2: Work on It

1. Edit the `.qmd` or `.R` file
2. Click **Render** to check your code runs
3. **Save** frequently

### Step 3: Commit Your Progress

1. Go to the **Git** pane
2. Check the boxes next to files you changed (Stage)
3. Click **Commit**
4. Write a message (e.g., "Completed question 1")
5. Click **Commit**

::: {.callout-tip}
Commit at least 3 times as you work. This shows your progress.
:::

### Step 4: Submit (Push)

1. Click **Push** (green up arrow) in the Git pane
2. Your work is now on GitHub!

### Step 5: Verify

1. Go to `github.bath.ac.uk` in your browser
2. Find your homework repo
3. Check your files are there and the commit time is before the deadline

## Coursework Workflow

Coursework is **summative** (graded). Same process as homework, but clone into `coursework/` folder.

### Clone Location

![Folder structure: MA22019 folder containing materials, homework, and coursework subfolders](../img/folder_structure.png)

```
MA22019/
├── homework/
│   └── hw_01-yourusername/   ← Homework goes here
└── coursework/
    └── cw_01-yourusername/   ← Coursework goes here
```

### The 3-Commit Rule

For coursework, we expect to see **at least 3 commits** showing your progress:

| Commit | Example Message |
|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | "Started data cleaning" |
| 2 | "Completed analysis section" |
| 3 | "Finished write-up and rendered final output" |

This helps us:

- Verify the work is yours
- Give partial credit if something breaks
- See your thought process

## Quick Reference: Pull vs Clone

| Situation | Action | Folder |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Get new labs | Pull (in materials project) | `materials/labs/` |
| Get lab solutions | Pull (in materials project) | `materials/lab_solutions/` |
| Start homework | Clone new repo | `homework/` |
| Start coursework | Clone new repo | `coursework/` |

---

## Semester Timeline

| Weeks | Activity | What to Do |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **1-5** | **Labs 0-4** | Pull materials weekly. Live Coding on Fridays (W1-3). |
| **5-6** | **Coursework 1** | Clone CW1 repo. Submit by deadline. |
| **7-10** | **Labs 5-8** | Pull materials weekly (Easter break in middle). |
| **10-11** | **Coursework 2** | Clone CW2 repo. Submit by deadline. |
| **11** | **Final** | Final submissions. |

## File Naming Rules

When creating your own files, follow these rules:

| Rule | Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|------|--------|---------|
| No spaces | `my analysis.R` | `my_analysis.R` |
| No special characters | `Joe's file.R` | `joes_file.R` |
| Use dates (YYYY-MM-DD) | `final_v2.R` | `2026-02-15_analysis.R` |
| Number for order | `intro.R`, `cleaning.R` | `01_intro.R`, `02_cleaning.R` |

## Common Questions

**Q: I forgot to pull before lab. What do I do?**
A: Just pull now. You'll get the latest labs immediately.

**Q: I can't find my homework repo.**
A: Check Moodle for the correct URL. Make sure you're logged into github.bath.ac.uk.

**Q: I accidentally cloned to the wrong folder.**
A: Delete the folder and clone again to the correct location.

**Q: How do I know my homework was submitted?**
A: Go to github.bath.ac.uk and check your repo. Your latest commit should be visible.
