## Before You Start

This guide assumes you've completed the [Computer Setup Guide](setup.qmd). If you haven't done that yet, [start there first](setup.qmd) — it only takes 15-20 minutes!

Welcome to your weekly workflow guide! 🗓️ This page tells you exactly what to do each week — no guessing required.

## The Big Picture: How This Course Works

Unlike traditional courses where you download ZIP files from Moodle, we use **GitHub** to keep everything organized. Here's the flow:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    subgraph GitHub["☁️ GitHub (github.bath.ac.uk)"]
        A["📁 Course Materials"]
        B["📁 Your Homework Repo"]
    end
    
    subgraph Computer["💻 Your Computer"]
        C["📁 materials/"]
        D["📁 homework/hw_01/"]
    end
    
    A -->|Pull weekly| C
    B -->|Clone once| D
    D -->|Push your work| B
    
    style A fill:#4a90d9,color:#fff
    style B fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style C fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style D fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

**Two simple concepts:**

| Action | When You Use It | What It Does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Pull** ⬇️ | Every week for labs & solutions | Downloads updates to a repo you already have |
| **Clone** 📋 | Once per homework/coursework | Creates a fresh copy of a new repo |

That's it! Master these two actions and you're set for the whole semester. 💪

## Your Weekly Routine

### 📚 Before Each Lab (Takes 30 Seconds!)

Every week, new lab materials get added to the `materials` repository. Here's how to get them:

1. **Open the materials project** 
   - Navigate to your `MA22019/materials/` folder
   - Double-click `materials.Rproj`
   
2. **Pull the latest updates**
   - Look for the **Git** pane (top-right area)
   - Click the **Pull** button (blue down arrow ⬇️)
   
3. **Check for new content**
   - New labs appear in `labs/`
   - Solutions appear in `lab_solutions/` (after they're released)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Make Pulling a Habit!

Pull *every time* you open the materials project. It takes 2 seconds and ensures you always have the latest content. Think of it like refreshing your email — do it automatically!
:::

### 🧪 During Lab

1. Navigate to `labs/lab_XX/`
2. Double-click `lab_XX.Rproj` to open that specific lab

::: {.callout-note}
## Switching Projects

When you open a new `.Rproj` file, RStudio will close your current project and open the new one. This is normal! Each project is like opening a different Word document.
:::

3. Work through the exercises
4. **Save frequently** (Ctrl/Cmd + S) — there's no auto-save!

Labs are for practice, so you don't submit them. Your work stays on your computer.

### ✅ After Lab (Getting Solutions)

Want to check your answers? Solutions are released after each lab:

1. Open the `materials` project (double-click `materials.Rproj`)
2. Click **Pull**
3. Check `lab_solutions/` — your answers are waiting!

---

## Live Coding Sessions (Weeks 1–3)

Friday sessions in Weeks 1, 2, and 3 are **Live Coding** — you'll code along with the lecturer in real-time. 

**Before each session:**

1. Open your `materials` project
2. Click **Pull** to get the latest files
3. Navigate to `live_coding/week_XX/`
4. Open the provided script and follow along!

These are great practice for seeing how experienced coders think and work. Don't worry about keeping up perfectly — focus on understanding the approach.

## Homework Workflow

Homework is **formative** (for learning, not your final grade). You'll get feedback from your TA to help you improve. Here's the full process:

### Step 1: Clone Your Personal Homework Repo

Each homework has a unique URL just for you. 

1. **Find your URL on Moodle** 
   - It looks like: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/hw_01-yourusername.git`
   
2. **Clone in RStudio**
   - Go to **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
   - Paste your URL
   - **Important!** Click **Browse** and navigate to `MA22019/homework/`
   - Click **Create Project**

![How cloning works](../img/git_clone_flow.png)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Clone to the Right Folder!

Always clone homework into `MA22019/homework/` and coursework into `MA22019/coursework/`. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to find your work later.
:::

### Step 2: Do the Work

1. Open the `.qmd` file provided
2. Work through the questions
3. Click **Render** regularly to check your code runs
4. **Save frequently!** (Ctrl/Cmd + S)

### Step 3: Commit Your Progress

Think of commits as "save points" in a video game. You want several of these!

1. Go to the **Git** pane (top-right)
2. Check the boxes next to files you changed (this is called "staging")
3. Click **Commit**
4. Write a brief message describing what you did (e.g., "Completed Q1 and Q2")
5. Click **Commit** again

::: {.callout-tip}
## Commit Early, Commit Often!

Aim for **at least 3 commits** per homework. This shows your progress and protects your work. If something breaks, you can always go back to a previous commit!
:::

### Step 4: Push Your Work (Submit!)

1. Click the **Push** button (green up arrow ⬆️)
2. Enter your Bath username and password if prompted
3. Done! Your work is now safely on GitHub 🎉

### Step 5: Verify Your Submission

Trust but verify! Make sure your work actually uploaded:

1. Go to `github.bath.ac.uk` in your browser
2. Find your homework repository
3. Check that:
   - Your files are there
   - The commit time is *before* the deadline
   - Your rendered HTML looks correct

## Coursework Workflow

Coursework is **summative** — it counts toward your final mark! The process is exactly the same as homework, but with one difference: **clone into the `coursework/` folder instead**.

### Your Folder Structure

```
MA22019/
├── materials/
├── homework/
│   ├── hw_01-yourusername/
│   └── hw_02-yourusername/
└── coursework/
    ├── cw_01-yourusername/   ← Coursework goes here!
    └── cw_02-yourusername/
```

### The 3-Commit Rule 📜

For coursework, we require **at least 3 commits** showing your progress. This isn't just bureaucracy — it serves important purposes:

| Why We Require It | How It Helps You |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Verifies authenticity | Shows it's genuinely your work |
| Enables partial credit | If something breaks, we can see what you did right |
| Creates checkpoints | You can roll back if you mess something up |

**Good commit messages look like:**

| Commit | Message |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | "Started data cleaning and exploration" |
| 2 | "Completed analysis section with visualizations" |
| 3 | "Finished write-up and rendered final HTML" |

## Semester Timeline

Here's what to expect week by week:

| Weeks | What's Happening | What You Do |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **1-5** | Labs 0-4 + Live Coding (W1-3) | Pull materials weekly |
| **5-6** | **Coursework 1** | Clone CW1, work on it, push before deadline |
| **7-10** | Labs 5-8 (Easter break included) | Pull materials weekly |
| **10-11** | **Coursework 2** | Clone CW2, work on it, push before deadline |
| **11** | Final submissions | Double-check everything is pushed! |

## Common Questions (FAQ)

**Q: I forgot to pull before lab. Am I in trouble?**

Nope! Just pull now — you'll get everything immediately. No harm done.

**Q: I can't find my homework repo URL.**

Check the Moodle page for the assignment. Make sure you're logged into `github.bath.ac.uk` (not `github.com`).

**Q: I cloned to the wrong folder. Help!**

Easy fix: delete the incorrectly-placed folder and clone again to the right location.

**Q: How do I know my work was actually submitted?**

Visit `github.bath.ac.uk`, find your repo, and check that your latest files and commit time are visible. If you can see it there, we can see it too!

**Q: RStudio is asking for my password every time I push.**

That's normal on university computers. Just enter your Bath credentials each time. On your personal laptop, you can set up credential caching to avoid this.
