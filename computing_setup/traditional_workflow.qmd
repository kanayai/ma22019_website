title: "Manual (Non-Git) Workflow"
---

---

> **Note**: This guide is for students who **cannot** use Git. If you are using Git (recommended), see the [Weekly Workflow Guide](weekly_workflow.qmd).

## 1. Organizing Your Workspace

Since you are managing files manually, you need a strict folder structure to keep things from getting lost.

### Where to store your files
- **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`
- **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/`
- **Mac:** `~/Documents/MA22019/`

### The Folder Structure
Create this structure inside your `MA22019` folder:

```
MA22019/
├── materials/                # Course materials (labs, solutions)
├── homework/                 # Your personal homework assignments
└── coursework/               # Your personal coursework assignments
```

### Inside an Assignment folder
Every assignment you download will look like this. **Do not mess with this structure!**

```
my_assignment/
├── my_assignment.Rproj   # DOUBLE-CLICK THIS to open RStudio
├── my_assignment.qmd     # Write your answers here
├── data/                 # Data files live here
└── README.md             # Instructions
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ WARNING: This workflow is **NOT RECOMMENDED**.

You will lose:

- Automatic backup (if your laptop breaks, your work is gone)
- Version history (can't "undo" to yesterday's version)
- Easy feedback (Tutors cannot easily see your code)
- Career skills (employers expect Git)

Use this only if you absolutely refuse to use GitHub Desktop/RStudio Git.

## 1. Getting the Assignment

Instead of cloning, you must manually download the files.

1. Go to the assignment page on `github.bath.ac.uk`
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Unzip the folder to your documents
5. **Rename the folder** (e.g., `hw_01_manual`) so you don't confuse it later

## 2. Doing the Work

1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
2. Work on your assignment
3. **Save often** (Ctrl+S) — RStudio does NOT auto-save your history like Git does

## 3. Submitting (The Hard Part)

You cannot "Push". You must manually upload files back to GitHub.

1. Go to your repo on `github.bath.ac.uk`
2. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**
3. Drag and drop your modified `.qmd` and `.html` files
4. Wait for them to upload
5. Click **Commit changes**

::: {.callout-note}
If you change your mind and edit the file again, you have to repeat the entire upload process.

## 4. Getting Feedback

Tutors mark on GitHub. To see their feedback:

1. Go to your repo
2. Click **Issues**
3. Read their comments
4. (You cannot "Pull" updates; you must manually check the website)

## Why we don't recommend this

- **It's risky**: One bad "Save" and you overwrite your only copy.
- **It's slow**: Dragging-and-dropping every time you make a change is tedious.
- **It's unprofessional**: Data scientists don't email zip files; they Push code.
