title: "Manual (Non-Git) Workflow"
---

---

> **Note**: This guide is for students who **opt-out** of using Git. If you are using Git (recommended), see the [Weekly Workflow Guide](weekly_workflow.qmd).

## 1. Organizing Your Workspace

Since you are managing files manually, you need a strict folder structure to keep things from getting lost.

### Where to store your files
- **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`
- **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/`
- **Mac:** `~/Documents/MA22019/`

### The Folder Structure
Create this structure inside your `MA22019` folder:

```
MA22019/
├── materials/                # Course materials (labs, solutions)
├── practice/                 # Practice labs
├── homework/                 # Your personal homework activities
└── coursework/               # Your personal coursework activities
```

### Inside an Activity folder
Every activity you download will look like this. **Do not mess with this structure!**

```
my_activity/
├── my_activity.Rproj     # DOUBLE-CLICK THIS to open RStudio
├── my_activity.qmd       # Write your answers here
├── data/                 # Data files live here
└── README.md             # Instructions
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ WARNING: This workflow is **NOT RECOMMENDED**.

You will lose:

- Automatic backup (if your laptop breaks, your work is gone)
- Version history (can't "undo" to yesterday's version)
- Easy feedback (Tutors cannot easily see your code)
- Career skills (employers expect Git)

Use this only if you absolutely refuse to use GitHub Desktop/RStudio Git.

## 1. Getting the Activity

Instead of cloning, you must manually download the files. There are two places you'll look, depending on what you need:

### A. For Course Materials (Labs, Lecture Notes)

These live in the central **materials** repository.

1. Go to the [materials repository](https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/materials)
2. Click the green **Code** button $\to$ **Download ZIP**
3. Open the ZIP and find the folder you need (e.g. `labs/lab_01`)
4. Copy that specific folder into your `MA22019/materials/` folder

### B. For Your Activities (Homework, Coursework)

These live in your **personal** repository (e.g., `hw_01-yourusername`).

1. Find your repository URL on Moodle (it points to `github.bath.ac.uk`)
2. Click the green **Code** button $\to$ **Download ZIP**
3. Unzip the folder
4. **Rename the folder** to something clear (e.g., `hw_01`) — remove the `-main` suffix if present.
5. Move it into your `MA22019/homework/` or `MA22019/coursework/` folder.

## 2. Doing the Work

1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
2. Work on your activity
3. **Save often** (Ctrl+S) — RStudio does NOT auto-save your history like Git does

## 3. Submitting (The Hard Part)

You cannot "Push". You must manually upload files back to GitHub.

1. Go to your repo on `github.bath.ac.uk`
2. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**
3. Drag and drop your modified `.qmd` and `.html` files
4. Wait for them to upload
5. Click **Commit changes**

::: {.callout-note}
If you change your mind and edit the file again, you have to repeat the entire upload process.

## 4. Getting Feedback

Tutors mark on GitHub. To see their feedback:

1. Go to your repo
2. Click **Issues**
3. Read their comments
4. (You cannot "Pull" updates; you must manually check the website)

## 5. Important Best Practices

Even without Git, you must follow these course rules:

### A. Submission Formats
When uploading your work, always submit:
1.  **Source Code**: `.qmd` or `.R` files.
2.  **Rendered Output**: `.md` files (if your .qmd generates one).
    - **Do NOT submit** HTML or PDF files unless specifically asked. The GitHub website cannot display them properly.

### B. File Naming Rules
Bad file names break code. Follow these rules:
*   **No spaces**: Use underscores (`my_file.R`) instead of spaces (`my file.R`).
*   **No special characters**: Avoid `!`, `?`, `&`, etc.
*   **Use dates**: `2026-02-01_analysis.R` is better than `analysis_final.R`.

### C. Data Management
*   **Small Data (< 10MB)**: It is okay to upload small CSV/Excel files.
*   **Large Data (> 10MB)**: Do **not** upload large datasets. Load them from a URL in your script instead.

## Why we don't recommend this

- **It's risky**: One bad "Save" and you overwrite your only copy.
- **It's slow**: Dragging-and-dropping every time you make a change is tedious.
- **It's unprofessional**: Data scientists don't email zip files; they Push code.
