## 🚨 Emergency Recovery (Top 5 Disasters)

These are the most common emergencies. Don't panic — they're all fixable!

### 1. "I Deleted My Homework Folder!"

**Good news**: Your work is safe on GitHub.

1. Go to `github.bath.ac.uk` in your browser
2. Find your homework repo (e.g., `hw_01-yourusername`)
3. Verify your files are there
4. Clone it again to `MA22019/homework/`

### 2. "Push Says 'Rejected'!"

**Cause**: You (or another computer) made changes on GitHub that you don't have locally.

**Fix**:

1. **Commit** your local changes first
2. Click **Pull** (blue down arrow) to merge changes from GitHub
3. Now click **Push** — it should work

### 3. "My Git Pane Disappeared!"

**Cause**: You're not in a Git project.

**Fix**:

1. Check the RStudio title bar — does it show a project name?
2. If not: **File → Open Project**
3. Navigate to your project folder and double-click the `.Rproj` file
4. Git pane should reappear in the top-right

### 4. "Pull Fails After I Edited Materials!"

**Cause**: You accidentally edited a file in `materials/` which is read-only.

**Fix**:

1. Go to the **Git** pane
2. Right-click the modified file
3. Click **Revert** or **Discard Changes**
4. Click **Pull** again — it works now!

### 5. "My Coursework/Homework Is 'Corrupt' or 'Broken'!"

**Cause**: Usually a sync conflict (OneDrive, iCloud) or Git state issue.

**Fix** (the "fresh start" approach):

1. **Rename** your broken folder (e.g., `hw_01-username_backup`)
2. **Clone** a fresh copy from GitHub to `MA22019/homework/`
3. **Copy** any work from the backup folder into the new clone
4. **Commit** and **Push** to save your work

::: {.callout-tip}
If you're regularly having issues, check if your folder is in a cloud-synced location. See "Cloud Sync Issues" below.

## 🛑 "Git Inside Git" (Nested Repositories)

**Symptom**: You can't stick your homework inside the `materials` folder! RStudio creates a "nested" repository that won't push correctly.

**The Rule**: Never clone a project *inside* another project folder.

**Fix**:

1. Close RStudio
2. Move your homework folder OUT of `materials/` and into `MA22019/homework/`
3. If it's still weird, use the "Fresh Start" fix above (Step 5)

---

## Git Pane Not Showing in RStudio

**Symptom**: You can't see the Git tab in the top-right pane.

### Fix 1: You're Not in a Git Project (Most Common!)

- **Check**: Look at the title bar (top right of RStudio). Does it say "Project: (None)"?
- **Explanation**: Git only works when you are inside a Git-enabled folder (a Project). If you just open a file like `lab_01.qmd` directly, RStudio doesn't know it's part of a repository.
- **Fix**:
  1. **File → Open Project**
  2. Navigate to your `MA22019/materials` or homework folder
  3. Double-click the `.Rproj` file

### Fix 2: H: Drive Security Issue (University PCs)

On university computers, security settings often hide the Git pane.

- **Check**: If Fix 1 didn't work and you are on a University PC.
- **Fix**: In RStudio **Terminal** (not Console), run:
  ```bash
  git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
  ```
- **Restart RStudio**

> **Note**: You might need to run this command again on different days or different computers. Ideally, run it once per session if the Git pane is missing!

### Fix 3: Git Executable Not Found (Rare)

- **Check**: Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
- If the "Git executable" box is empty, you need to install Git (see Setup Guide).

---

## Cloud Sync Issues (OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox)

**Symptom**: Git crashes, "corrupt index" errors, or strange behavior.

### Cause

Your project is in a folder that's being synced by OneDrive, iCloud, or Dropbox. These services conflict with Git.

### Fix

1. **Move your project** out of the synced folder:
   - **Windows**: Move from `Documents/` to `C:\MA22019\`
   - **Mac**: Move from `Documents/` to `~/MA22019/` (home folder)
2. **Re-clone from GitHub** if the project is corrupted:
   - Delete the broken folder
   - Clone again to the new, non-synced location

### How to Check If a Folder Is Synced

- **Windows**: Look for a cloud icon on the folder in File Explorer
- **Mac**: Go to *System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive → Options* and check if "Desktop & Documents Folders" is ON

## Git Not Installed (University PC)

**Symptom**: RStudio says "Git not found" or the Git executable path is empty.

### Fix 1: Check if Git is Already There

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Start menu → type `cmd`)
2. Type: `git --version`
3. If you see a version number, Git is installed
4. Type: `where git` to find the path
5. Copy that path into RStudio's Git/SVN settings

### Fix 2: Use the MinGit Workaround

If Git isn't installed and you can't install software:

1. Download **MinGit** (ZIP) from [Git for Windows Releases](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases)
2. Open File Explorer, type `%localappdata%` in the address bar
3. Create a folder named `Git`
4. Extract the MinGit ZIP contents into that folder
5. In RStudio: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
6. Set Git executable to: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Git\cmd\git.exe`
7. Restart RStudio

### Fix 3: Use Physical Lab Computer

Remote Desktop machines often have Git blocked. Try a physical lab computer instead.

## Git Doesn't Work on UniDesk/UniApps (Remote Desktop)

**Symptom**: You're connected to a university computer remotely and Git operations (Clone, Pull, Push) fail or hang.

### Cause

UniDesk (AVD) and UniApps (RDS) are remote desktop solutions that don't support Git properly. While you can use RStudio to write and run R code, the Git connection to GitHub doesn't work through these services.

### Fix

**Option 1**: Use a **physical lab computer** on campus. Git works normally on these.

**Option 2**: Install R, RStudio, and Git on your **own laptop** (see [Setup Guide](setup.qmd)).

::: {.callout-note}
UniDesk/UniApps is still useful for writing and testing R code. Just don't expect Git to work!

## ⚠️ W: Drive Warning (Personal Web Space)

**Symptom**: You saved something to the W: Drive and now you're worried.

The **W: Drive** (`\\waltz.campus.bath.ac.uk\wwwgroup`) is your **Personal Web Space**:

- ⚠️ **PUBLIC RISK**: Files saved here may be visible to anyone on the internet!
- ❌ **NEVER** save RStudio projects, homework, or coursework here
- ❌ If your solution is findable via Google, you could be flagged for **Academic Misconduct**

### Fix

1. Move your files to the **H: Drive** or your local `MA22019/` folder
2. Delete anything you accidentally saved to W: Drive
3. Only use W: Drive if explicitly asked to host a final webpage

---

## 🌐 WebDrive (files.bath.ac.uk) Not Working with RStudio

**Symptom**: You tried to use files.bath.ac.uk with RStudio and it doesn't work.

**Explanation**: The **files.bath** web interface is browser-based only. RStudio cannot:

- See files inside a web browser
- Run code from WebDrive
- Save plots or use Git

### Fix

Use WebDrive only for emergencies (e.g., downloading a single file on a public computer). For actual work, map your H: Drive directly (see [Setup Guide](setup.qmd)).

---

## I Cloned to the Wrong Folder

**Symptom**: Your homework ended up on the Desktop or in the wrong place.

### Fix

1. **Delete** the incorrectly cloned folder (it's okay, your work is on GitHub)
2. Clone again, this time:
   - In "Create project as subdirectory of", click **Browse**
   - Navigate to `MA22019/homework/` or `MA22019/coursework/`
   - Click **Create Project**

### Verify Correct Location

Run this in the R Console:

```r
# For homework
if (grepl("MA22019/homework", getwd())) {
  cat("✅ Correct location!")
} else {
  cat("❌ Wrong location. Current:", getwd())
}
```

## Push Failed / Authentication Error

**Symptom**: RStudio asks for username/password and then fails with "Invalid username or password".

### For github.bath.ac.uk (Our Course)

- **Username**: Your Bath username (e.g., `abc123`)
- **Password**: Your university password

If it still fails:

1. Make sure you're connected to the internet
2. If off-campus, connect to the **University VPN** first
3. Try logging into github.bath.ac.uk in your browser to confirm your credentials work

### If You Enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Symptom**: You're certain your password is correct, but Git still says "Invalid username or password".

**Cause**: With 2FA enabled, your regular password **no longer works** for Git operations. You need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead.

**Fix**:

1. Go to `github.bath.ac.uk` → Click your profile picture → **Settings**
2. Left sidebar → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
3. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
4. Fill in:
   - **Note**: "RStudio access"
   - **Expiration**: Choose a reasonable time (e.g., 90 days)
   - **Scopes**: Check **`repo`** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **Generate token**
6. **Copy the token immediately** — you won't see it again!
7. When RStudio asks for credentials:
   - **Username**: Your Bath username
   - **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your regular password)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Save Your Token!

GitHub will **never show your token again** after you leave the page. Save it immediately in a password manager (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden, or your browser's password manager):

- **Website**: `github.bath.ac.uk`
- **Username**: Your Bath username (e.g., `abc123`)
- **Password**: Your Personal Access Token
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
On macOS, your token will likely be saved to Keychain after the first successful Git operation, so you won't need to enter it every time.
:::

### Do I have to log in every time?

- **Personal Laptop**: No. Your computer (Keychain/Credential Manager) remembers your password or token.
- **Lab Computer**: Maybe. If you log out and move to a different computer, you might need to enter your credentials again. This is normal security.

## Pull Failed

**Symptom**: Clicking Pull gives an error.

### Fix 1: You Have Uncommitted Changes

If you see "Cannot pull with uncommitted changes":

1. Go to the Git pane
2. Check the boxes next to modified files
3. Click **Commit**
4. Write a message and click **Commit**
5. Now try **Pull** again

### Fix 2: Network Issues

1. Check your internet connection
2. If off-campus, ensure VPN is connected
3. Try again in a few minutes

---

## Merge Conflict

**Symptom**: You see `<<<<<<< HEAD` in your file.

This happens rarely. It means you and someone else (or you on another computer) edited the same file.

### Fix

1. Open the file with the conflict
2. Look for markers like:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   your version
   =======
   their version
   >>>>>>> main
   ```
3. **Delete** the markers and keep the version you want
4. Save the file
5. In Git pane: Stage the file → Commit → Push

**If you're stuck**: Ask a Tutor for help. Don't panic!

---

## Can't Access H: Drive from Home

**Symptom**: You can't see your H: Drive on your personal laptop.

### Fix

1. Install and connect to the **University VPN** ([VPN Guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/setting-up-vpn-on-your-device/))
2. Then map the drive:
   - **Windows**: `\\myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk\yourusername`
   - **Mac**: `smb://myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk/yourusername`

---

## RStudio Crashes or Freezes

### Fix 1: Close Other Programs

RStudio needs memory. Close Chrome tabs, other apps, etc.

### Fix 2: Restart Fresh

1. Close RStudio completely
2. Reopen RStudio
3. Go to **File → Recent Projects** and select your project

### Fix 3: Delete .RData File

If RStudio keeps crashing on startup:

1. Navigate to your project folder in File Explorer
2. Delete the `.RData` file (if it exists)
3. Reopen RStudio

---

## My Files Disappeared!

### If You Were Using Git

Your work is probably safe on GitHub:

1. Go to github.bath.ac.uk
2. Find your repo
3. Check if your files are there
4. Clone the repo again to get them back

### If You Never Pushed

Check these locations:

- Your recent file location (File Explorer → Recent)
- The H: Drive (if you were on a lab PC)
- Your Downloads folder

---

## I Accidentally Edited a File in Materials

**Symptom**: The Git pane shows changes in the `materials` project.

### Fix: Discard Your Changes

1. In the Git pane, right-click the file
2. Click **Revert** or **Discard Changes**
3. Your file returns to the original version

This is safe because you can always Pull again to get the latest content.

---

## Still Stuck?

1. **Ask a Tutor** during lab or office hours
2. **Post on the Moodle forum** (others may have the same issue)
3. **Email the instructor** for urgent issues

When asking for help, include:

- What you were trying to do
- The exact error message (screenshot if possible)
- What you already tried
