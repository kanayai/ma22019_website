> **Goal**: Reference details for your R, RStudio, and Git setup. Use this guide whenever you move to a new computer or need to reset your environment.

**New to Git?** Read [Why Learn Git?](why_teach_github.md) first.

## 🏁 START HERE: Which path are you on?

Choose your adventure:

*   **A) "I am using the Lab Computers"** → Skip to Section 1A.
*   **B) "I am using my own Laptop"** → Start at Section 1B.

---

## 1A. Using Lab Computers

**Good news**: R, RStudio, and Git are already installed!

*   **Log in** to the PC.
*   Skip to **Section 2: Configure Git in RStudio**.

## 1B. Using Your Own Laptop

If you are using your own machine, you need to install a few things first.

If you're using your own laptop, install these before the first lab:

| Software | Download Link |
|----------|--------------|
| R | [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org) |
| RStudio | [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) |
| Quarto | [quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |

**University lab computers** already have R and RStudio installed.

## Your Computational Toolkit

Here are the tools you'll use in this course:

| Tool | What It Is | Analogy |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **R** | The programming language for data analysis | Like English — the language you write in |
| **RStudio** | The software where you write R code | Like Microsoft Word — your writing interface |
| **Quarto** | Creates documents with code AND text | Like a Word doc that can run code |
| **Git** | Version control (tracks changes) | Like "Track Changes" in Word, but better |
| **GitHub** | Cloud storage for your Git projects | Like Google Drive, but for code |

::: {.callout-note}
R is the language, RStudio is the interface. You write R code *inside* RStudio.

**Want more on Git?** See [Why Learn Git?](why_teach_github.md) for the full explanation with examples.
:::

### Quarto: Your New Document Format

In this course, you won't use Word or Google Docs. Instead, you'll write **Quarto documents** (`.qmd` files) that contain:

- Your written analysis (in English)
- Your code (in R)
- The output of your code (plots, tables, results)

When you **Render** a Quarto document, everything combines into a beautifully formatted HTML or PDF file!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Also taking MA22015 (Statistics 2B)?

In MA22015, you use **R Markdown** (`.Rmd` files) instead of Quarto (`.qmd` files). Don't worry — they're very similar!

| Feature | R Markdown (`.Rmd`) | Quarto (`.qmd`) |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Used in | MA22015 | MA22019 (this course) |
| Button to run | **Knit** | **Render** |
| File header | Uses `output: html_document` | Uses `format: html` |
| Syntax | Nearly identical | Nearly identical |

Think of Quarto as the "next generation" of R Markdown — same idea, slightly updated syntax. Skills transfer directly between them!

### An Analogy to Writing an Essay

Think of it like writing an essay for a literature class:

| Literature Class | Data Science (This Course) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Language: English | Language: R |
| Interface: Microsoft Word | Interface: RStudio |
| Document: .docx file | Document: .qmd (Quarto) file |
| Track Changes | Git |
| Google Drive | GitHub |

![Comparison of tools: R is like English, RStudio is like Word, Quarto is like a .docx, Git is like Track Changes, and GitHub is like Google Drive](../img/r-english-analogy.jpg)

---

## A Quick Tour of RStudio

When you first open RStudio, you'll see **three panes**. The fourth pane (Source) appears when you open a file.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Where's the Source pane?** It only appears when you open a file (`.R`, `.qmd`, etc.). Go to **File → Open File** or double-click a file in the Files pane to see it.
:::

![RStudio interface showing the four main panes: Source (top-left), Console (bottom-left), Environment (top-right), and Files/Plots/Help (bottom-right)](../img/rstudio_interface.png)

| Pane | Location | What It Does |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Top-left | Where you write and edit code files (.R, .qmd) — *appears when you open a file* |
| **Console** | Bottom-left | Where you run code and see immediate output |
| **Environment** | Top-right | Shows your data and variables |
| **Files/Plots/Help** | Bottom-right | Browse files, view plots, get help |

> **Tip**: If a pane is missing, go to **View → Panes → Show All Panes**.

### The Most Important Buttons

| Button | Where | What It Does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Run** | Source pane toolbar | Runs the current line of code |
| **Render** | Source pane toolbar | Converts your .qmd to HTML/PDF |
| **Pull** | Git pane (top-right) | Downloads updates from GitHub |
| **Push** | Git pane (top-right) | Uploads your work to GitHub |

![Git workflow: Clone for first download, Pull to get updates, Push to upload your work](../img/git_workflow.png)

## 2. Configure Git in RStudio

Git is the version control system that connects RStudio to GitHub. You need to set it up once.

### On University Lab Computers

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. Check that the **Git executable** box shows a path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`)
   - If it's empty or says "Not Found", see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.qmd)
4. Click **OK**

### On Personal Computers (Windows)

If Git isn't already installed:

1. Download Git from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer — accept all defaults
3. Open **RStudio**
4. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
5. The Git executable should now show `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`
6. Click **OK**

### On Personal Computers (Mac)

Git is usually pre-installed on Macs. To check:

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. Check if the Git executable shows `/usr/bin/git` or similar

If Git is not found:

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If prompted, click **Install** to install the Xcode Command Line Tools
4. Restart RStudio and check Git/SVN settings again

### Tell Git Who You Are

In the RStudio **Console**, run this once (replace with your details):

```r
install.packages("usethis")  # Only needed once
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "abc123@bath.ac.uk")
```

## 3. Create Your Folder Structure

All your course work lives in one folder. Create this structure:

### Where to Put It

| Computer Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| University PC | `H:\MA22019\` |
| Windows laptop | `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MA22019\` |
| Mac | `~/Documents/MA22019/` |

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Do NOT save your projects in cloud-synced folders!

Cloud sync services (OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive) corrupt Git repositories. Git creates thousands of tiny files that these services try to sync, causing crashes and data loss.

**Check your setup:**

- **Windows**: If your Documents folder shows a cloud icon, it's synced to OneDrive. Create your folder at `C:\MA22019\` instead.
- **Mac**: Go to *System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive → Options*. If "Desktop & Documents Folders" is ON, create your folder at `~/MA22019/` (in your home folder, not Documents).
- **University PCs**: The H: Drive is safe — use that!
:::

### The Folder Structure

Create these folders (you'll use them throughout the semester):

![Folder structure: MA22019 folder containing materials, homework, and coursework subfolders](../img/folder_structure.png)

```
MA22019/
├── materials/         ← You'll clone this in Week 1
├── homework/          ← Clone homework assignments here
└── coursework/        ← Clone coursework assignments here
```

**How to create folders in RStudio:**

1. Open RStudio (not inside any project)
2. In the **Files** pane (bottom-right), navigate to your Documents
3. Click **New Folder** → type `MA22019`
4. Click into `MA22019/`
5. Click **New Folder** → type `homework`
6. Click **New Folder** → type `coursework`

## Understanding RStudio Projects

An **RStudio Project** is a folder with a special `.Rproj` file that tells RStudio "this is a project."

### Why Use Projects?

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Working directory** | R knows where your files are — no confusing file paths |
| **Everything together** | Data, code, and output all in one place |
| **Reproducible** | Your code works on any computer, not just yours |
| **Git integration** | The Git pane appears automatically |

### How to Open a Project

1. Navigate to the project folder in File Explorer/Finder
2. Double-click the `.Rproj` file
3. RStudio opens with that project loaded

> **Rule**: Always work inside a project! If you don't see a `.Rproj` file in your Files pane, you're probably not in a project.

## 4. Clone the Materials Repository

The `materials` repo contains all course content: case studies, labs, and solutions. You clone it once and pull updates weekly.

1. In RStudio: **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
2. **Repository URL**: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/materials.git`
3. **Create project as subdirectory of**: Browse to `MA22019/` and click **Open**
4. Click **Create Project**

RStudio will download the materials and open the project automatically.

### Verify It Worked

- You should see a **Git** tab in the top-right pane
- The **Files** pane should show folders like `case_studies/`, `labs/`, etc.
- You should also see a file called `check_location.R`.

---

## 5. Test Pull (Verify Your Setup)

After cloning, test that you can pull updates:

1. In the **Git** pane (top-right), click the **Pull** button (blue down arrow)
2. You should see a message like "Already up to date" or files appearing
3. ✅ If you see the Git pane and Pull works, your setup is complete!

---

## 6. Authentication (If Asked for Password)

If RStudio asks for a username and password when cloning:

- **Username**: Your Bath username (e.g., `abc123`)
- **Password**: Your university password

::: {.callout-note}
We use `github.bath.ac.uk` (enterprise GitHub) which uses your university login. You do NOT need a Personal Access Token or SSH keys for this course.
:::

---

## Using the H: Drive (University Network Storage)

Your **H: Drive** is personal network storage backed up by IT. It's the safest place for your work on university computers.

### On Campus (Lab PCs)

The H: Drive is automatically available:

1. Open **File Explorer** (Win+E)
2. Look for **(H:)** under "This PC"

### From Home (Personal Laptop)

1. Connect to the **University VPN** first ([VPN Guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/setting-up-vpn-on-your-device/))
2. Map the network drive:
   - **Windows**: Right-click This PC → Map network drive → `\\myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk\username`
   - **Mac**: Finder → Go → Connect to Server → `smb://myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk/username`

---

## Quick Reference Card

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Open materials | Double-click `materials.Rproj` in your MA22019 folder |
| Get new labs/solutions | Open materials project → Git pane → **Pull** |
| Start homework | Clone your assigned repo into `homework/` folder. Run `check_location.R` to verify. |
| Start coursework | Clone your assigned repo into `coursework/` folder. Run `check_location.R` to verify. |
