title: "Computer Setup Guide"
---

Use this guide when setting up at the start of the semester, or whenever you move to a new computer or need to reset your environment.

# 🏁 1. START HERE: Which path are you on?

Choose your adventure:

*   **A) "I am using  University  of Bath Computers"** → [Skip to Section 1A](#a.-using-university-of-bath-computers).
*   **B) "I am using my own Laptop"** → [Start at Section 1B](#b.-using-your-own-laptop).

---

## 1A. Using University of Bath Computers

**Good news**: R, RStudio, and Git are already installed!

*   **Log in** to the PC.
*   [Skip to **Section 2: Configure Git in RStudio**](#configure-git-in-rstudio).

## 1B. Using Your Own Laptop

If you are using your own machine, you need to install a few things first.

If you're using your own laptop, install these before the first lab:

| Software | Download Link |
|----------|--------------|
| R | [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org) |
| RStudio | [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) |
| Quarto | [quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |

In all cases, choose your operating system and then download the installer. 

**University of Bath computers** already have Quarto, R and RStudio installed.

# Your Computational Toolkit

Here are the tools you'll use in this course:

| Tool | What It Is | Analogy |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **R** | The programming language for data analysis | Like English — the language you write in |
| **RStudio** | The software where you write R code | Like Microsoft Word — your writing interface |
| **Quarto** | Creates documents with code AND text | Like a Word doc that can run code |
| **Git** | Version control (tracks changes) | Like "Track Changes" in Word, but better |
| **GitHub** | Cloud storage for your Git projects | Like Google Drive, but for code |

::: {.callout-note}
R is the language, RStudio is the interface. You write R code *inside* RStudio.

:::


---

## A Quick Tour of RStudio

When you first open RStudio, you'll see **three panes**. The fourth pane (Source) appears when you open a file.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Where's the Source pane?** It only appears when you open a file (`.R`, `.qmd`, etc.). Go to **File → Open File** or double-click a file in the Files pane to see it.
:::

![RStudio interface](../img/rstudio_interface.png)

| Pane | Location | What It Does |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Top-left | Where you write and edit code files (.R, .qmd) — *appears when you open a file* |
| **Console** | Bottom-left | Where you run code and see immediate output (look for the `>` prompt) |
| **Environment** | Top-right | Shows your loaded data, variables, objects, and Git buttons |
| **Files/Plots/Help** | Bottom-right | Browse files, view plots, get help |

> **Tip**: If a pane is missing, go to **View → Panes → Show All Panes**.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Use Source Mode, Not Visual Mode

When editing `.qmd` files, RStudio offers two modes: **Source** and **Visual**. We recommend **Source mode** because:

- You see exactly what's in the file (no hidden formatting)
- You learn Markdown syntax (a transferable skill used across many tools)
- It's easier to debug rendering issues
- Visual mode can sometimes introduce unwanted formatting changes

You can switch modes using the toggle at the top-left of the Source pane.
:::

### The Most Important Buttons

| Button | Where | What It Does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Run** | Source pane toolbar | Runs selected lines of code |
| **Render** | Source pane toolbar | Converts your .qmd to HTML/PDF |
| **Pull** | Git pane (top-right) | Downloads updates from GitHub |
| **Push** | Git pane (top-right) | Uploads your work to GitHub |

---

## Quarto: Your New Document Format

In this course, you won't use Word or Google Docs. Instead, you'll write **Quarto documents** (`.qmd` files) that contain:

- Your written analysis (in English)
- Your code (in R)
- The output of your code (plots, tables, results)

When you **Render** a Quarto document, everything combines into a beautifully formatted HTML or PDF file!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Also taking MA22015 (Statistics 2B)?

In MA22015, you use **R Markdown** (`.Rmd` files) instead of Quarto (`.qmd` files). Don't worry — they're very similar!

| Feature | R Markdown (`.Rmd`) | Quarto (`.qmd`) |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Used in | MA22015 | MA22019 (this course) |
| Button to run | **Knit** | **Render** |
| File header | Uses `output: html_document` | Uses `format: html` |
| Syntax | Nearly identical | Nearly identical |

Think of Quarto as the "next generation" of R Markdown — same idea, slightly updated syntax. Skills transfer directly between them!
:::

## An Analogy to Writing an Essay

Think of it like writing an essay for a literature class:

| Literature Class | Data Science (This Course) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Language: English | Language: R |
| Interface: Microsoft Word | Interface: RStudio |
| Document: .docx file | Document: .qmd (Quarto) file |
| Track Changes | Git |
| Google Drive | GitHub |

![Comparison of tools: R is like English, RStudio is like Word, Quarto is like a .docx, Git is like Track Changes, and GitHub is like Google Drive](../img/r-english-analogy.jpg)

# 2. Configure Git in RStudio

**New to Git?** See [Why Learn Git?](why_teach_github.md) first.

Git is the version control system that connects RStudio to GitHub. You need to set it up once.

## On University Lab Computers

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. Check that the **Git executable** box shows a path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`)
   - If it's empty or says "Not Found", see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.qmd)
4. Click **OK**

## On Personal Computers (Windows)

If Git isn't already installed:

1. Download Git from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer — accept all defaults
3. Open **RStudio**
4. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
5. The Git executable should now show `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`
6. Click **OK**

## On Personal Computers (Mac)

Git is usually pre-installed on Macs. To check:

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. Check if the Git executable shows `/usr/bin/git` or similar

If Git is not found:

**On Windows** (if Git isn't detected):

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Start menu → type `cmd`)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If it shows a version, Git is installed — copy the path from `where git` into RStudio settings
4. If "not recognized", install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**On Mac:**

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) 
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If prompted, click **Install** to install the Xcode Command Line Tools
4. Restart RStudio and check Git/SVN settings again

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Git Does NOT Work on Remote Desktop (UniDesk/UniApps)

If you're connecting to university computers remotely using **UniDesk** or **UniApps**, Git will **not work**. RStudio works, but Git operations (Clone, Pull, Push) fail.

**Solution**: Use a **physical lab computer** on campus, or install R/RStudio/Git on your own laptop.

For more information, see the [UniDesk/UniApps guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/working-remotely-with-uniapps-and-unidesk/).
:::

## Tell Git Who You Are

In the RStudio **Console** (the pane with the `>` prompt, usually bottom-left), run this once (replace with your details):

```r
install.packages("usethis")  # Only needed once
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "abc123@bath.ac.uk")
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important: Use Your Bath Account Only

- Use your **Bath email address** (`abc123@bath.ac.uk`), not your personal email
- You **cannot** use a personal GitHub account for this course
- We use `github.bath.ac.uk` (University of Bath's enterprise GitHub), which is separate from `github.com`
- Your Bath username and password work automatically — you don't need to create a new account

# 3. Create Your Folder Structure

All your course work should live in one folder. Create this structure:

## Where to put the MA22019 folder

| Computer Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| University PC | `H:\MA22019\` |
| Windows laptop | `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MA22019\` |
| Mac | `~/Documents/MA22019/` |

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Do NOT save your projects in cloud-synced folders!

Cloud sync services (OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive) corrupt Git repositories. Git creates thousands of tiny files that these services try to sync, causing crashes and data loss.

**The MA22019 folder can go anywhere that is NOT cloud-synced.**

**Check your setup:**

- **Windows**: If your Documents folder shows a cloud icon, it's synced to OneDrive. Create your folder at `C:\MA22019\` or any other local folder that isn't synced (e.g., `D:\MA22019\`).
- **Mac**: Go to *System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive → Options*. If "Desktop & Documents Folders" is ON, create your folder at `~/MA22019/` (in your home folder, not Documents), or any other non-synced location.
- **University PCs**: The H: Drive is safe — use that!
:::

## The Folder Structure

Create these folders (you'll use them throughout the semester):

![MA22019 folder structure](../img/folder_structure.png)

```
MA22019/
├── materials/         ← You'll clone this in Week 1
├── homework/          ← Clone homework assignments here
└── coursework/        ← Clone coursework assignments here
```

::: {.callout-note}
You can create these folders using your operating system (File Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac) or using RStudio as shown below.
:::

**How to create folders in RStudio:**

1. Open RStudio (not inside any project)
2. In the **Files** pane (bottom-right), navigate to your Documents (or chosen location)
3. Click **New Folder** → type `MA22019`
4. Click into `MA22019/`
5. Click **New Folder** → type `homework`
6. Click **New Folder** → type `coursework`

::: {.callout-tip}
## That's All the Folders You Need to Create!

If you're following the Git workflow (recommended), this is the only manual folder creation you need to do. When you clone repositories for homework or coursework, the folders are created automatically.

See the [Weekly Workflow Guide](weekly_workflow.qmd) for details on cloning assignments.
:::

# 4. Clone the Materials Repository

The `materials` repository (or repo) contains all course content: case studies, labs, and solutions. You clone it once and pull updates weekly.

1. In RStudio: **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
2. **Repository URL**: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/materials.git`
3. **Create project as subdirectory of**: Browse to `MA22019/` and click **Open**
4. Click **Create Project**

RStudio will download the materials and open the project automatically.

## Verify It Worked

- You should see a **Git** tab in the top-right pane
- The **Files** pane should show folders like `case_studies/`, `labs/`, etc.
- You should also see a file called `check_location.R`.

---

##  Test Pull (Verify Your Setup)

After cloning, test that you can pull updates:

1. In the **Git** pane (top-right), click the **Pull** button (blue down arrow)
2. You should see a message like "Already up to date" or files appearing
3. ✅ If you see the Git pane and Pull works, your setup is complete!


## Understanding RStudio Projects

When you clone or pull updates from the course repository, you'll see an unfamiliar file with the extension `.Rproj`. This is an **RStudio Project file** — it tells RStudio "this is a project."

### Why Use Projects?

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Working directory** | R knows where your files are — no confusing file paths |
| **Everything together** | Data, code, and output all in one place |
| **Reproducible** | Your code works on any computer, not just yours |
| **Git integration** | The Git pane appears automatically |

### How to Open a Project

When you want to work on a specific lab or homework assignment:

1. Navigate to the project folder in File Explorer/Finder
2. Double-click the `.Rproj` file
3. RStudio opens with that project loaded

### You'll Have Multiple .Rproj Files

As you progress through the course, your MA22019 folder will contain **multiple `.Rproj` files** — one for each activity:

```
MA22019/
├── materials/
│   └── materials.Rproj      ← For pulling course content
├── homework/
│   ├── hw_01/
│   │   └── hw_01.Rproj      ← Homework 1
│   └── hw_02/
│       └── hw_02.Rproj      ← Homework 2
└── coursework/
    └── cw_01/
        └── cw_01.Rproj      ← Coursework 1
```

This is normal and expected. Each `.Rproj` file keeps that assignment's work separate. **Open one project at a time** — don't try to open multiple projects simultaneously.

> **Rule**: Always work inside a project! If you don't see a `.Rproj` file in your Files pane, you're probably not in a project. 


## Authentication (If Asked for Password)

If RStudio asks for a username and password when cloning:

- **Username**: Your Bath username (e.g., `abc123`)
- **Password**: Your university password

::: {.callout-note}
We use `github.bath.ac.uk` (enterprise GitHub) which uses your university login. You do NOT need a Personal Access Token or SSH keys for this course.
:::

---

## Using the H: Drive (University Network Storage)

Your **H: Drive** is personal network storage backed up by IT. It's a safe place for your work on university computers.

### On Campus (Lab PCs)

The H: Drive is automatically available:

1. Open **File Explorer** (Win+E)
2. Look for **(H:)** under "This PC"

### From Home (Personal Laptop)

1. Connect to the **University VPN** first ([VPN Guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/setting-up-vpn-on-your-device/))
2. Map the network drive:
   - **Windows**: Right-click This PC → Map network drive → `\\myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk\username`
   - **Mac**: Finder → Go → Connect to Server → `smb://myfiles.campus.bath.ac.uk/username`

### Alternative: Using UniDesk or UniApps

You can also access university computers remotely using [UniDesk or UniApps](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/working-remotely-with-uniapps-and-unidesk/).

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Git Does NOT Work on Remote Desktop

**Important reminder**: If you're using UniDesk or UniApps, **Git will not work**. You can use RStudio to write and run code, but you won't be able to Clone, Pull, or Push.

For Git workflows, use a physical lab computer or your own laptop with R/RStudio/Git installed locally.
