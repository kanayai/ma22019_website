title: "Computer Setup Guide"
---

Welcome! 🎉 This guide will get you up and running for the semester. Don't worry — we'll walk you through every step. You've got this!

# 🏁 1. START HERE: Which path are you on?

Choose your adventure:

*   **A) "I'm using University of Bath Computers"** → [Skip to Section 1A](#a.-using-university-of-bath-computers). Lucky you — everything's pre-installed!
*   **B) "I'm using my own Laptop"** → [Start at Section 1B](#b.-using-your-own-laptop). A bit more work, but totally worth it!

---

## 1A. Using University of Bath Computers

**Great news!** R, RStudio, Quarto and  and Git are already installed. The IT team has done the hard work for you! 🙌

*   Just **log in** to a PC.
*   Then [jump straight to **Section 2: Create Your Folder Structure**](#create-your-folder-structure).

## 1B. Using Your Own Laptop

Using your own machine? Brilliant — having your own setup means you can work from anywhere.

You'll need to install **four** things before your first lab:

| Software | Download Link |
|----------|--------------|
| R | [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org) |
| RStudio | [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) |
| Quarto | [quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |
| Git | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

Just choose your operating system and download the installer. The installation wizards will guide you through — accept the defaults and you'll be fine!

---

## 1C. Install R Packages (The "Apps")

R is like a new phone—it's great, but you need to install "apps" (called **packages**) to make it useful.

We have prepared a **Master Script** that installs everything you need for the semester (Tidyverse, Mapping tools, etc.).

1.  Open RStudio.
2.  Go to **File > New File > R Script**.
3.  Copy and paste the code below into the new file.
4.  Select all the code (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A).
5.  Click **Run** (or press Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter).

```r
# MA22019: Master Package Installation Script
# Run this entire chunk to install/update course packages

install_if_missing <- function(packages) {
  new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
  if(length(new_packages)) {
    message("Installing: ", paste(new_packages, collapse = ", "))
    install.packages(new_packages)
  } else {
    message("✅ All packages in this group are already installed.")
  }
}

# 1. Core Data Science
install_if_missing(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "lubridate"))

# 2. Visualization
install_if_missing(c("patchwork", "RColorBrewer", "scales"))

# 3. Text Analysis
install_if_missing(c("tidytext", "wordcloud", "textdata"))

# 4. Spatial Analysis
install_if_missing(c("sf", "tmap", "ggspatial", "prettymapr", "sp", "gstat", "spatstat", "raster"))

message("🎉 Setup Complete! You are ready for MA22019.")
```

> **Note:** This might take a few minutes. If it asks "Do you want to restart R prior to installing?", click **Yes**.

# Your Computational Toolkit

Let's meet the tools you'll be using this semester. Don't worry if they sound unfamiliar — by Week 2, they'll feel like old friends!

| Tool | What It Is | Think of It Like... |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **R** | The programming language for data analysis | The language you speak (like English) |
| **RStudio** | The software where you write R code | Your word processor (like Microsoft Word) |
| **Quarto** | Creates documents with code AND text | A Word doc that can actually *run* code! |
| **Git** | Version control (tracks all your changes) | "Track Changes" on steroids 💪 |
| **GitHub** | Cloud storage for your Git projects | Like Google Drive, but designed for code |

::: {.callout-note}
## Quick Clarification
R is the *language*, RStudio is the *interface*. You write R code *inside* RStudio — just like you write English *inside* Word!
:::


---

## A Quick Tour of RStudio

When you first open RStudio, don't panic if it looks complicated! You'll see **three panes** initially. The fourth one (Source) appears when you open a file.

::: {.callout-tip}
**"Where's the fourth pane?!"** The Source pane only appears when you open a file (`.R`, `.qmd`, etc.). Go to **File → Open File** or double-click any file in the Files pane to reveal it.
:::

![RStudio interface](../img/rstudio_interface.png)

| Pane | Location | What It Does |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Top-left | Your code editor — where the magic happens! ✨ |
| **Console** | Bottom-left | Run code and see immediate results (look for the `>` prompt) |
| **Environment** | Top-right | Shows your data, variables, and those all-important Git buttons (when activated, see below) |
| **Files/Plots/Help** | Bottom-right | Browse files, admire your plots, get help when stuck |

> **Pro tip**: If a pane goes missing (it happens!), go to **View → Panes → Show All Panes** to bring it back.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Use Source Mode, Not Visual Mode

When editing `.qmd` files, RStudio offers two modes: **Source** and **Visual**. We *strongly* recommend **Source mode** because:

- You see exactly what's in the file — no mystery formatting hiding in the background
- You'll learn Markdown syntax (a skill that transfers to blogs, READMEs, documentation, and more!)
- It's way easier to debug when something goes wrong
- Visual mode can sometimes sneak in unwanted formatting changes

Switch modes using the toggle at the top-left of the Source pane. Trust us on this one!
:::

### The Most Important Buttons

You'll use these buttons constantly. Memorize them and you'll fly through your work!

| Button | Where | What It Does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Run** | Source pane toolbar | Runs your selected code — see results instantly! |
| **Render** | Source pane toolbar | Transforms your `.qmd` into HTML, PDF or plain markdown |
| **Pull** | Git pane (top-right) | **Downloads** the latest updates from GitHub |
| **Push** | Git pane (top-right) | **Uploads** your amazing work to GitHub |

---

## Quarto: Your New Document Format

Forget Word and Google Docs — in this course, you'll create **Quarto documents** (`.qmd` files). These are special because they combine:

- 📝 Your written analysis (in plain English)
- 💻 Your code (in R)
- 📊 The output of your code (plots, tables, results — all auto-generated!)

When you click **Render**, everything magically combines into a beautifully formatted HTML or PDF. It's like having a robot assistant who formats your reports perfectly every time!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Also taking MA22015 (Statistics 2B)?

Good news! In MA22015, you use **R Markdown** (`.Rmd` files) which is basically Quarto's older sibling. They're *very* similar!

| Feature | R Markdown (`.Rmd`) | Quarto (`.qmd`) |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------| 
| Used in | MA22015 | MA22019 (this course) |
| Button to run | **Knit** | **Render** |
| File header | Uses `output: html_document` | Uses `format: html` |
| Syntax | Nearly identical | Nearly identical |

Think of Quarto as the "next generation" upgrade. Skills transfer directly between them — you're basically learning two tools for the price of one! 🎁
:::

## An Analogy to Writing an Essay

Still feeling a bit overwhelmed? Think of it like writing an essay for a literature class:

| Literature Class | Data Science (This Course) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Language: English | Language: R |
| Interface: Microsoft Word | Interface: RStudio |
| Document: .docx file | Document: .qmd (Quarto) file |
| Track Changes | Git |
| Google Drive | GitHub |

![Comparison of tools](../img/r-english-analogy.jpg)

See? You've been doing a version of this your whole academic life. Now you're just leveling up! 🚀

# 2. Create Your Folder Structure

Let's get organized! All your course work will live in one tidy folder. This takes 2 minutes and will save you *hours* of confusion later.

## Where to put the MA22019 folder

| Computer Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| University PC | `H:\MA22019\` |
| Windows laptop | `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MA22019\` |
| Mac | `~/Documents/MA22019/` |

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AVOID Cloud-Synced Folders at All Costs!

This is really important: **Do NOT** save your projects in OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive folders!

Why? Cloud sync services and Git are mortal enemies. Git creates thousands of tiny files that these services try to sync simultaneously, causing crashes, corruption, and heartbreak. 💔

**The MA22019 folder can go anywhere that is NOT cloud-synced:**

- **Windows**: If your Documents folder shows a cloud icon, create your folder at `C:\MA22019\` instead
- **Mac**: Go to *System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive → Options*. If "Desktop & Documents" is ON, use `~/MA22019/` (your home folder) instead
- **University PCs**: The H: Drive is safe — use that!
:::

## The Folder Structure

Create these three folders — you'll use them all semester:

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    root[MA22019]
    root --> materials[materials/]
    root --> practice[practice/]
    root --> homework[homework/]
    root --> coursework[coursework/]

    style root fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style materials fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd
    style practice fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style homework fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00
    style coursework fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b
```

```
MA22019/
├── materials/         ← You'll clone this in Week 1
├── practice/          ← Clone practice labs (like Lab 00) here
├── homework/          ← Clone homework assignments here
└── coursework/        ← Clone coursework assignments here
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🛑 CRITICAL: Do NOT Move Folders Around!
Once you have created this structure, **do not move or rename these folders**.

- If you clone a repo into `practice/` and then drag-and-drop it into `materials/`, **Git will break**.
- If you rename `MA22019` to `My_Maths_Notes`, **RStudio will get confused**.

Set it up once, leave it alone, and let RStudio manage the files inside. Simplicity is key!
:::

::: {.callout-note}
You can create these folders using File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac), or use RStudio as shown below — whatever feels comfortable!
:::

**How to create folders in RStudio** (optional method):

1. Open RStudio (not inside any project! Dont know what is a project? see below)
2. In the **Files** pane (bottom-right), navigate to your Documents (or chosen location)
3. Click **New Folder** → type `MA22019`
4. Click into `MA22019/`
5. Click **New Folder** → type `homework`
6. Click **New Folder** → type `coursework`

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎉 That's All the Folders You Need!

If you're following the Git workflow (which you should!), this is the *only* manual folder creation you'll do all semester. When you clone homework or coursework, the folders appear automatically. Pretty neat, right?

You can jump to the [Weekly Workflow Guide](weekly_workflow.qmd) for details on how cloning works.

## Using the H: Drive (University Network Storage)

Your **H: Drive** is personal network storage that IT backs up for you. It's a safe, reliable place for your work on university computers.

### On Campus (Lab PCs)

The H: Drive is automatically available — no setup needed! 

1. Open **File Explorer** (Win+E)
2. Look for **(H:)** under "This PC"

That's it!

### From Home (Personal Laptop)

Want to access your H: Drive from home without using UniDesk or UniApps? Check the official university guides:

*   **Windows**: [How to access your H: Drive vs VPN (Windows)](https://bath.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=f523cfb9-5538-4701-b5f9-2f0ed4ef8403)
*   **Mac**: [How to access your H: Drive vs VPN (Mac)](https://bath.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=16fc851afa754c558990c0b890124c26)

# 3. Configure Git in RStudio

**New to Git?** Curious why we bother with version control? Check out [Why Learn Git?](why_teach_github.md) — it's a quick read and might change how you feel about it!

Git is the version control system that connects RStudio to GitHub. You only need to set it up once per computer — then you're good to go!

## On University Lab Computers

The good news: Git is already installed. But there is **one critical step** you must do to make it work with the university network drives (H: Drive).

### ⚠️ Critical: Fix the "Dubious Ownership" Error

To verify your setup and ensure the Git pane appears:

1. Open **RStudio**.
2. Click the **Terminal** tab (next to **Console**, usually bottom-left).
3. Copy and paste this exact command and press **Enter**:

   ```bash
   git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
   ```

4. **Restart RStudio** (close and reopen it).

::: {.callout-note}
## Why do I need this?
The University H: Drive has strict security settings that confuse Git. This command tells Git "It's safe to use folders on this computer."

**If your Git pane ever disappears in the future, just run this command again!** It resets occasionally on university PCs.
:::

Done! That was easy, right? ✅

## On Personal Computers (Windows)

If Git isn't already installed, let's fix that (or confirm it worked):

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. The Git executable should now show `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`
4. Click **OK**

High five! 🙌 You're all set!

## On Personal Computers (Mac)

Great news for Mac users — Git usually comes pre-installed! Let's check:

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**
3. Check if the Git executable shows `/usr/bin/git` or similar

## If Git isn't found

Here's what to do:

**On Windows** 

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Start menu → type `cmd`)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If it shows a version number, Git is installed! Copy the path from `where git` into RStudio settings
4. If it says "not recognized", install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**On Mac:**

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) 
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If prompted, click **Install** to get the Xcode Command Line Tools
4. Restart RStudio and check Git/SVN settings again

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Heads Up: Git Does NOT Work on Remote Desktop (UniDesk/UniApps)

If you're connecting to university computers remotely using **UniDesk** or **UniApps**, Git will **not work**. You can use RStudio fine, but Clone/Pull/Push operations will fail.

**Your options**: Use a **physical lab computer** on campus, or install R/RStudio/Git on your own laptop (honestly, it's worth it!).

More info: [UniDesk/UniApps guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/working-remotely-with-uniapps-and-unidesk/).
:::

## Tell Git Who You Are

Almost there! Git needs to know your name and email so it can track who made which changes. 

In the RStudio **Console** (the pane with the `>` prompt, usually bottom-left), run this once — just replace the example with *your* details:

```r
install.packages("usethis")  # Only needed once
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "abc123@bath.ac.uk")
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important: Use Your Bath Account Only

- Use your **Bath email address** (`abc123@bath.ac.uk`), not your personal email
- You **cannot** use a personal GitHub.com account for this course
- We use `github.bath.ac.uk` (University of Bath's enterprise GitHub), which is completely separate from `github.com`
- Your Bath username and password work automatically — no need to create anything new!
:::

# 4. Clone the Materials Repository

Time for the exciting part! 🎬 The `materials` repository will eventually contain all your course content: case studies, labs, and solutions. You'll clone it once, then pull updates weekly.

![How cloning works](../img/git_clone_flow.png)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Why Clone Instead of Downloading from Moodle?

You might be wondering: "Why not just download files from Moodle like in other courses?" Great question! Here's why Git is better:

**The Old Way (Moodle):**

1. Lecturer uploads homework to Moodle
2. You log in, find the right folder, download a ZIP file
3. You unzip it... somewhere on your computer
4. Weeks later: "Where did I put that file?" 😩
5. If the lecturer updates a file, you have to re-download everything and figure out what changed

**The Git Way:**

1. You clone once — everything lands in the right place automatically
2. When updates are available, you click **Pull** and only the *changed* files update
3. Your folder structure stays organized forever
4. Git tracks what changed and when — no guessing!
5. Your work is automatically backed up to GitHub

Think of it like the difference between printing every email vs. using Gmail. One is clunky and creates chaos; the other just *works*. 📧
:::

Here's how to clone the materials:

1. In RStudio: **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
2. **Repository URL**: `https://github.bath.ac.uk/ma22019-2026/materials.git`
3. **Project directory name**: you can leave that blank if has not been already filled with `materials`
4. **Create project as subdirectory of**: Browse to `MA22019/` and click **Open**
5. Click **Create Project**

RStudio will download everything and open the project automatically. Magic! ✨

## Authentication (If Asked for Password)

If RStudio asks for credentials when cloning, use:

- **Username**: Your Bath username (e.g., `abc123`)
- **Password**: Your university password

::: {.callout-note}
We use `github.bath.ac.uk` (enterprise GitHub) which connects to your university login. You do NOT need a Personal Access Token or SSH keys for this course — keep it simple!
:::


## Verify It Worked

Take a moment to check everything looks right:

- ✅ You should see a **Git** tab in the top-right pane
- ✅ The **Files** pane should show folders like `case_studies/`, `labs/`, etc.
- ✅ You should see a file called `check_location.R`

If you see all three, give yourself a pat on the back! 🎉

---

##  Test Pull (Verify Your Setup)

One last check! Let's make sure you can pull updates:

1. In the **Git** pane (top-right), click the **Pull** button (blue down arrow ⬇️)
2. You should see a message like "Already up to date" or watch files appear
3. ✅ If the Git pane works and Pull runs without errors, **your setup is complete!**

Congratulations — you're ready to do data science! 🚀


# 5. RStudio Projects

When you clone or pull from the course repository, you'll notice an unfamiliar file with a `.Rproj` extension. This is an **RStudio Project file** — think of it as a bookmark that tells RStudio "this folder is a project."

### Why Use Projects?

Projects make your life *so* much easier:

| Benefit | What It Means For You |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Working directory** | R knows where your files are — no more confusing file paths! |
| **Everything together** | Data, code, and output all live in one tidy place |
| **Reproducible** | Your code works on any computer, not just yours |
| **Git integration** | The Git pane appears automatically when you need it |

### How to Open a Project

When you want to work on a specific lab or homework:

1. Navigate to the project folder in File Explorer/Finder
2. Double-click the `.Rproj` file
3. RStudio opens with that project loaded — you're ready to code!

### You'll Have Multiple .Rproj Files

As the semester progresses, your MA22019 folder will fill up with `.Rproj` files — one for each activity:

```
MA22019/
├── materials/
│   ├── materials.Rproj      ← For pulling course content
│   ├── labs/
│   │   ├── lab_01.Rproj
│   │   └── lab_02.Rproj
│   ├── lab_solutions/
│   │   └── lab_01_sols.Rproj
│   └── live_coding/
│       └── live_coding_01.Rproj
├── practice/
│   └── lab-00-yourusername/
│       └── lab-00.Rproj     ← Practice Lab 00
├── homework/
│   ├── hw-01-yourusername/
│   │   └── hw_01.Rproj      ← Homework 1
│   └── hw-02-yourusername/
│       └── hw_02.Rproj      ← Homework 2
└── coursework/
│   └── cw-01-yourusername/
│       └── cw_01.Rproj      ← Coursework 1
```

This is totally normal! Each `.Rproj` file keeps that assignment's work separate and organized. Just remember: **open one project at a time** — don't try to juggle multiple!

> **Golden Rule**: Always work inside a project! If you don't see a `.Rproj` file in your Files pane, you're probably not in one.

# 6. Using UniDesk 

You can also access university computers remotely using [UniDesk](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/working-remotely-with-uniapps-and-unidesk/).

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Reminder: Git Does NOT Work on Remote Desktop

One more time for the people in the back: **Git doesn't work on UniDesk!** You can write and run R code, but Clone/Pull/Push won't work.

For Git workflows, use a physical lab computer or your own laptop with R/RStudio/Git installed locally.
:::
