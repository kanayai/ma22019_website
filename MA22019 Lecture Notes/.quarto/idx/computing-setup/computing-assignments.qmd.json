Click it to:\n- Create your personal copy of the assignment repository\n- This copy is linked to your GitHub account\n\n### Step 2: Clone to Your Computer\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## WHERE TO SAVE? (Critical)\n**Do NOT** save this project in OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Cloud sync services corrupt Git repositories.\n\n**Recommendation:** Use your University **H: Drive** (Network mapped drive).\n👉 **[Read the H: Drive Setup/Map Guide](setup-university-drive.qmd)**\n:::\n\n```bash\n# Copy the repository URL from GitHub (click green \"Code\" button)\ngit clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/assignment-name.git\n\n# Navigate into the project folder\ncd assignment-name\n```\n\n**In VS Code:**\n1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)\n2. Type \"Git: Clone\"\n3. Paste the repository URL\n4. Choose where to save it\n\n### Step 3: Work on Your Assignment\n\n1. Open the `.qmd` file(s) provided\n2. Read the instructions carefully\n3. Write your code and answers\n4. **Save frequently!**\n\n### Step 4: Commit Regularly\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Commit at Least 3 Times!\nWe expect to see a progression of work in your commits. This helps us:\n- Verify the work is yours\n- Give partial credit if something breaks\n- Provide better feedback\n:::\n\nAfter completing each major section:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Complete Question 1 - data exploration\"\n```\n\nGood commit points:\n- After each question or section\n- Before trying something risky\n- At the end of each work session\n\n### Step 5: Push to GitHub\n\n```bash\ngit push\n```\n\n**Your work is now submitted!** The state of your repository at the deadline is your submission.\n\n---\n\n## Assignment Repository Structure\n\nEach assignment repository will contain:\n\n```\nassignment-name/\n├── README.md           # Instructions overview\n├── assignment.qmd      # Main file you'll edit\n├── data/               # Datasets for the assignment\n│   └── dataset.csv\n└── .gitignore          # Files to ignore\n```\n\n---\n\n## What Gets Graded?\n\n### Content (80%)\n\n| What We Look At | Why It Matters |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Your `.qmd` file | Your code and written answers |\n| Rendered output | Does your code run correctly? |\n| Accuracy | Are your answers correct? |\n| Completeness | Did you attempt all questions? |\n\n### Workflow Points (20%)\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## The 3-Commit Rule\nYou **must commit at least 3 times** as you work through each assignment. This is a graded requirement!\n:::\n\nWe grade your Git workflow to ensure you're developing good habits:\n\n| Requirement | Points | What We Check |\n|-------------|--------|---------------|\n| **Minimum 3 commits** | 10% | We look at your commit history |\n| **Final files in repo** | 5% | Both `.qmd` and rendered output on GitHub |\n| **Organization** | 5% | Clean repo, meaningful commit messages |\n\n**Why do we require multiple commits?**\n\n1. **Proves progression**: Shows you worked incrementally, not all at once\n2. **Enables recovery**: If something breaks, you have earlier working versions\n3. **Mirrors industry**: Professional developers commit frequently\n4. **Protects you**: We can give partial credit if your final version has issues\n\n**Good vs. Bad commit practices:**\n\n| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |\n|--------|---------|\n| 1 giant commit at the deadline | Commits after each question |\n| \"done\" as commit message | \"Complete Q1: data cleaning and summary stats\" |\n| Only `.qmd` file pushed | Both `.qmd` and `.html`/`.pdf` pushed |\n\n---\n\n## Deadlines and Late Policy\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Important!\n- **Deadline**: The state of your GitHub repository at the deadline time\n- **Late submissions**: 10% penalty per day, up to 3 days\n- **After 3 days**: No submissions accepted without prior arrangement\n:::\n\n### How to Check Your Submission\n\n1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)\n2. Navigate to your assignment repository\n3. Verify:\n   - ✅ Your `.qmd` file is there and up to date\n   - ✅ All files are committed\n   - ✅ Last commit time is before the deadline\n\n---\n\n## Getting Your Own Copy Started\n\nIf you want to work on something **not** from an assignment invite link:\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Create new repository on GitHub] --> B[Clone to your computer]\n    B --> C[Add your files]\n    C --> D[Commit and push]\n    \n    style A fill:#202329,color:#fff\n    style D fill:#EC0836,color:#fff\n```\n\n### Creating a New Repository\n\n1.

Git will show a conflict:\n   ```\n   <<<<<<< HEAD\n   Your version\n   =======\n   Their version\n   >>>>>>> \n   ```\n2. Edit the file to keep what you want\n3. Remove the conflict markers\n4.
