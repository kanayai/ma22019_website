Organizing Your Workspace\n\nWhether you are using a university PC (H: Drive) or your own laptop, you need a dedicated home for this course.\n\n**Where should you put it?**\n*   **Uni PC:** `H:/MA22019/`\n*   **Windows (Personal):** `Documents/MA22019/`\n*   **Mac/Linux:** `~/Documents/MA22019/`\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## ⚠️ WARNING: Is your \"Documents\" folder synced?\nOn many Macs (iCloud) and Windows PCs (OneDrive), the **Documents** folder is automatically synced to the cloud.\n**Git + Cloud (iCloud/OneDrive) = Data Loss.**\n\n**Check this:**\n1.  **Mac:** System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options > Desktop & Documents Folders. If this is ON, **do not save your work in Documents**. Create a folder in your User Home directory instead (e.g., `/Users/yourname/MA22019`).\n2.  **Windows:** Check if your Documents has a green tick (OneDrive). If so, make a folder directly on your C: drive (e.g., `C:\\MA22019`) to be safe.\n:::\n\n### Recommended Folder Structure\n\nWe recommend the following structure to handle the **three types of activities** in this course:\n\n```\nMA22019/\n├── 01_Labs/                  # Weekly Computer Labs (Formative)\n│   ├── Week_01_Lab/\n│   │   └── Lab_01.Rproj\n│   ├── Week_02_Lab/\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── 02_Homework/              # Weekly Homework Questions (Formative)\n│   ├── Week_01_HW/\n│   │   └── HW_01.Rproj\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── 03_Coursework/            # Assessed Summative Work (Graded)\n│   ├── CW_1_Wrangling/       # Coursework 1 Repository (Assessed)\n│   └── CW_2_Project/         # Coursework 2 Repository (Assessed)\n│\n└── 04_Resources/             # Lecture notes, cheat sheets\n    ├── ggplot2_cheatsheet.pdf\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### The Three Activity Types\n1.  **Labs (Formative):** These are the exercises we do together in the computer labs. Great for practice.\n2.  **Homework (Formative):** Weekly open-ended questions. These help you verify your understanding.\n3.  **Coursework (Summative):** These are the **two major assessed** pieces of work. These **MUST** be Git repositories (see [Assignment Workflow](computing-assignments.qmd)). Keep them in `03_Coursework` so you don't accidentally mix them up with your weekly practice files.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inside a Project (The \"Tidy\" Project)\n\nEvery time you start a new RStudio Project (e.g., for a Lab or Coursework), use this internal structure:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n├── my_project.Rproj    # RStudio Project file (NEVER delete this)\n├── README.md           # Explanation of what this project does\n├── data/               # Raw and processed data\n│   ├── raw/\n│   └── processed/\n├── R/                  # R scripts (if you have complex functions)\n├── output/             # Plots, tables, and saved results\n└── analysis.qmd        # Your main report/analysis\n```\n\n### Why this matters?\n1.  **Relative Paths:** You can load data with `read.csv(\"data/raw/my_data.csv\")`. This works on your computer, your friend's computer, and the marker's computer.\n2.  **Clean Workspace:** `output/` keeps your generated files (which you can delete and regenerate) separate from your source code.\n3.  **Sanity:** You know exactly where to find the raw data vs. the cleaned data.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## 1.
